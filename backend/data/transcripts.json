    "content": "Intro and how Open Spaces works\n0:02\nhello hello hello thank you for joining us uh you have just tuned in to the\n0:08\nMarch 13th edition of the gimbal labs open spaces uh community meeting this\n0:14\nmeeting is open to everyone uh we're glad that you joined us I'm going to give you a little rundown of what we do\n0:20\nhere uh typically every Thursday around this time which is 14 something\n0:28\nUTC um possibly and uh we are a\n0:34\ncommunity of Learners and typically we're building\n0:40\nand doing little our projects but on Thursdays we sort of put on our administrator hats and we\n0:48\ndo I wouldn't it's governance but uh it's uh we we uh work through our\n0:55\nprojects and we kind of get into the executive function we do a consent decision making process based Loosely on\n1:03\nthe S3 sociocracy 3.0 model and there is a notion board that\n1:12\nI'm going to share right now or uh Hara oh I'm I'm facilitating my name is\n1:19\nNewman uh I'm co- facilitating uh with Hara say hello Harsha\n1:25\nhey right hey Harsha I'm GNA share my screen\n1:30\nand I wonder if uh let's see we'll go through our agenda for today and the agenda is is\n1:40\nbased on these projects and this notion board can everybody see the notion\n1:47\nboard yes okay perfect\n1:53\num this is sort of how we manage things here in gimbal labs and\n2:00\nuh there are proposals anybody is welcome to create a proposal um the the\n2:06\nprojects look like this when they come off of the boiler plate C out of the\n2:11\npress um it's a title and all this sort of stuff you can just write in your idea\n2:17\nin this format and it goes into a uh a pipeline starts with these\n2:23\nproposals um and then it goes to sort of planning a backlog of ones that are are\n2:30\nare sort of on the back burner and then today we go to this community review and\n2:36\nconsent that's what we're here for and so this is our um this is our agenda for\n2:45\ntoday to go through some of these proposals and one of the cool things you can do\n2:52\nin uh in uh in noce is you can move things\n2:58\naround and so this is our idea for today is to talk about this first one uh the\n3:04\nwitch spaces January through June 2025 this one is important uh harsh you want\n3:09\nto explain why this one is important for today absolutely so uh for f-13 sustain\n3:17\nand maintain gimal Labs proposal uh we submitted the first Milestone and we submitted the WID spaces proposal as one\n3:24\nof the things that was consented on but the reviewers were very specific about\n3:31\nwhere the consent was uh and I have to answer to them so I was thinking we could get to the consent one way or the\n3:37\nother and then we can submit it to the review so that we can get through Milestone one and get the payment and\n3:43\ndistribute it to whoever needs it yeah perfect perfect and it's basically and I\n3:50\ncan pull that up but it it basically the Milestone reviewers was saying hey there's some a few specific things and I\n3:57\nremember one of those was who uh will cons who will commit to host and\n4:02\nfacilitate these these spaces uh in our next in then in the next uh few months\n4:10\nis that right\n4:15\nyeah um okay so that's the one that we're going to start first so I'm giving you sort of the agenda and then we're\n4:22\ngoing to talk about then we can decide whether we want\n4:27\nto go through this uh this marketing plan uh which kind of was a\n4:35\nspinoff of this wi spaces because we we were we thought that the the marketing\n4:41\nitself should have its own own proposal uh and then something that is uh\nGimbalabs DRep vote on “Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%”. Final vote: abstain.\n4:47\nsomething that I've really focused on this week is this um the the DP vote as you know gimal\n4:57\nLabs is also a DP so a uh our community is a community of learners but we're\n5:02\nalso a constituency and vote as a as a DP and the in the cardano governance I\n5:09\ndo want to call out and ask Scott um I he took the initiative um uh and is\n5:19\nfocused on if you don't know Scott ratio um he is he is his own D and he's\n5:26\nfocused in on on the on Community governance um and he went through this\n5:33\nuh proposal format and drafted um some great things the things that I want to\n5:39\nhighlight are the pros and cons and this is where we could have a good\n5:45\ndiscussion uh around this um\n5:51\nproposal uh all right so that is by way of agenda there two hands up uh new adri\n6:00\nand Sebastian sorry oh okay um Adrian Adrian yeah go ahead wouldn't it\n6:08\nwouldn't it make more sense to um have the vote proposal first because SC has\n6:13\nto drop off in 20 minutes so we wouldn't make much sense\n6:19\nto discuss a proposal where the owner is not present yeah that's true yeah that's true um we\n6:27\nhad we well actually it does actually that does make sense if we want to discuss that for the next 20 minutes\n6:32\nbecause because then we'll just we'll have a hard stop at 11 when Scott takes off um how do you feel about\n6:40\nthat sounds good to me yeah actually that does sound good um uh and let's uh\n6:48\nlet's begin that discussion now all right\n6:55\nso has everyone does every can everyone one can they see my screen or is uh who\n7:02\nhas not seen this proposal or does not know anything about it the first part of\n7:07\nthe consent decisionmaking process uh and it sort of looks like\n7:14\nthis oh boy um uh is basically reading and\n7:21\nunderstanding this uh what the vote is all about um is anybody\n7:27\nunclear I mean who who has some some questions about what this governance\n7:32\naction is about uh I I don't know what the treasury tax is so Scott if you\n7:38\ncould just give us like a a basic summary about what treas tax is and how\n7:44\nit affects like the everyday cardo user that'd be really awesome oh man that'd be great yeah my understanding on the\n7:52\ntax that I believe is T is actually to in the uh um in the parameters for cardano and\n7:59\nit's supposedly a tax that goes to the treasury from all transaction fees and also I believe from the reserve the\n8:07\ncardono reserve that's released at um three I guess it's 3/10 of whatever the\n8:13\nremaining uh Reserve is is released every every epic and so 20 so it's it's 20% goes to\n8:23\ninto the treasury essentially 80% of of rewards goes out to the spos and then that's\n8:30\ndistributed to the to the stakers um through the through those that stake to\n8:36\nthe spos as rewards um now cardono Foundation wrote a white\n8:42\npaper on it and they claim that it's closer to 32 and a half to\n8:47\n35% um but then also in the same breath cardano actually found the proposal\n8:54\nunconstitutional so um that's it I mean if you have any other questions on I'm not expert expert on tow I did my own\n9:00\nresearch on it and Tred to come up with my own formulas and models to help determine how it would impact cardano\n9:06\nbut that's much harder than I anticipated I'm sorry I just wanted to\n9:12\nask about that study that you're referring to or what do you mean with it's closer to do you mean the tax\n9:19\nitself is closer to 30% yes that's what that's what cardano\n9:24\nFoundation is stating in their white paper I me I can I can dig it up and put a link to it in theuh chat\n9:30\nyeah if you have it that would be amazing sure give me a second I'll get it to you excellent and so so that's a\n9:38\nthat's an important question to ask about like what what is this what is this tax and where does it come from\n9:44\nwhen you read the the the governance action material here\n9:53\num it can give you some some clue as to where it is but it does require some uh\n10:00\nsome thought and I know that that uh that Scott as a d uh you know has his\n10:06\nown opinion and everybody has their opinion uh and I think I think that Scott was thinking of voting yes but I\n10:15\nin the Discord we we heard from Adrian who had a strong um opinion as well and\n10:22\nso I wanted to see if Adrien could uh could come up and sort of you know help\n10:29\nto help us to understand the proposal um from that perspective so the treasury um\n10:37\nfunds are going into to developers or yeah there are for um yeah building the\n10:44\nkadano protocol and also to Catalyst and I think as G gims we definitely cannot\n10:53\nvote uh yes to cut the rate because all our funds are coming from that treasury\n10:58\nmore or less it wouldn't make sense to yeah cut ourself our own funds\n11:07\noff right I mean I kind of feel like I think that that's sort of I mean does\n11:16\nthat let's see uh because this is where this is where catalyst is funded with\n11:21\nthis with this 20% of the of the Dow\n11:27\nexactly um okay Simon has his hand up okay thank\n11:33\nyou yes Simon what do you got what I understand is that\n11:39\num that the that some of the funds would go\n11:45\nrather to the spos right right\n11:52\nyeah you mean not the treasury funds are going to the sbos the uh cut so the 10%\n12:00\nthat right would go to the treasury would then go to the SOS and also sure\n12:05\nto ourself if we are staking to the spos right but chimber laabs has its own\n12:12\nStak pool as well no right right I mean I still agree that with\n12:20\nwith the point I think chimber labs mix more through uh Grant\n12:26\nbut I mean what do I know but that's my strong suspicion yeah I mean if you go\n12:32\nto the projects page then only income is from Catalyst and all the proposals uh\n12:38\nor projects are funded because of catalyst\n12:44\nright yeah that is true and I think that that's a that's an important point is\n12:50\nthat gimal laabs is is funded indeed uh from this you know tax or the\n12:59\nthe way I've always explained is it's the physics of the blockchain that whenever we make a\n13:05\ntransaction portion of that uh whenever there's any activity portion of that goes into this Treasury and a portion of\n13:11\nthat treasury goes to Catalyst and a portion of that Catalyst funds goes to\n13:17\ngimal apps and is uh is paying me and and Harsha right now right now um which\n13:24\nis great which is great um some of the pros and cons\n13:30\nuh so if you have access and let me share\n13:36\nthis um link if you have access you can put a comment into this\n13:45\num into this uh message uh into this notion page\n13:52\nwe'll put that out there [Music]\n14:00\nokay so I think Simon is your hands still up do you have more comments or\n14:07\nokay so I want to do this as an S3 thing we have only only have about five more\n14:14\nminutes so I want to just get uh a temperature check and a quick clarifying\n14:22\nround uh do you feel like so here's the question as we do a around um do you\n14:28\nfeel like like we like you need more information or do you have like an\n14:33\nopinion I don't want you to say your opinion uh because this isn't because we don't have enough time to sort of at\n14:39\nthis moment uh uh to discuss opinions but I just want to get your sense of\n14:44\nlike oh yeah this is important I want to talk more about it or or or not um so we'll have a quick round um\n14:53\nI oh I feel\n14:59\nnow the question is kind of hard for me I feel I feel like I have enough\n15:04\ninformation to make an informed consent um like I don't I don't need to\n15:10\nask any more clarifying questions um James how how about you do you feel you\n15:16\nknow do you have like any kind of reaction or you feel like you have enough information I have enough\n15:24\ninformation okay cool Adrian um I'm uh\n15:30\nAdrian and then Andrew yeah yes I have enough information yeah okay perfect\n15:36\nperfect Andrew and then\n15:43\nEmanuel uh Andrew do you feel like you've got you know like you have a strong opinion or\n15:49\ndo you feel like you want you have enough information or or if there's something that uh you you want to bring\n15:54\nup Andrew okay we're going to move on to Manuel and then\n16:05\nARA okay Emanuel came off mute but I can't hear you you can put it\n16:12\nin the chat also and that might help us if you right now oh yeah we got you\n16:17\nbuddy okay yeah sorry uh so what I was saying is whatever that uh would be\n16:24\nhelpful to gimal Labs uh indirectly uh it should be considered that I think uh\n16:29\nScott mentioned um on uh the rational sorry I don't know um on what he thinks\n16:37\nis going to be helpful to gims in um um this um when um there's a decision\n16:45\non um the decrease of Treasury tax uh which is indirectly helping gimal laabs\n16:52\nin you know in the funding process so yes I think we should move on with that\n16:59\nokay okay yeah um paraa and then\n17:05\nMartin uh I I feel like I have enough information not that I can make a Deion\n17:11\nbut I think I have enough information and also I understand that gimal ABS currently depends on Catalyst but I\n17:18\npersonally I don't want the status quo to continue uh I really hope like we can be self- sustainable and not depend on\n17:25\nexternal organizations yeah a good point that's a good point um Martin and then\n17:32\nMonique I'm uh listening with a half ear so okay all right listening nice uh\n17:40\nMo'Nique and then Nelson so I honestly I'm catching up to\n17:46\nspeed a little bit I I I think I understand what's happening here and our\n17:51\nparticular position being funded by cadas but um I think that so the overall\n17:57\nlike purpose or or goal of of of this proposal um it was it's to increase hold\n18:06\non this is uh is to it's justified by uh increased staking uh returns and um\n18:14\npromoting decentralization I and I think that's like that's supposed to be the the\n18:20\nbenefit correct am I getting that right okay yeah okay yeah okay so I I I I\n18:26\nunderstand and um I have enough information I am perfect yeah perfect\n18:32\nthank you um Nelson and then\n18:37\nScott um yeah I also have enough information to understand proposal um\n18:43\nyeah and I have an opinion about it okay okay cool cool um let's go to Scott\n18:51\nScott I definitely know just to hear your voice though buddy yeah I've got enough information I just I do want to\n18:57\nlet everybody know that I'm not trying to sway a decision either of the way for gimal abbs um and I don't know if my\n19:03\napproach to this proposal was correct because I've never written a proposal for gimbal ABS so um anyway that's that\n19:09\nbut yeah I have enough information thank you excellent yeah and I do want to I do want to highlight that uh as I see James\n19:16\nwith the hand clapping this um you know we're not you know the consent a consent\n19:22\nprocess like this is making like a a civil container um I do want to recognize that Scott took the initiative\n19:29\nto sort of take on this with some with some you know uh uh um it was difficult\n19:36\nhe expressed how difficult it was because there's sort of conflict of interest and he's very uh fastidious or\n19:43\nvery uh like he he takes it very seriously this this sort of conflict of\n19:49\ninterest and and trying to be a representative uh and he does this more just to get the ball rolling and\n19:57\nlikewise I want to um acknowledge Adrien who was able to give like a good\n20:02\nCounterpoint like we have this phrase about getting to the no and that a no or\n20:08\nan objection is really a gift because that gives us the the space to sort of work these things out um so we're not\n20:15\ntrying to say this is right or this is wrong we're just trying to go through a process to sort of ascertain the thing\n20:21\nokay okay um uh Sebastian and then\n20:27\nSimon yeah I having information perfect so you got it the\n20:32\nbest um\n20:40\nSimon got oh yeah that's right he's already done um okay so I know that I\n20:46\nknow that Scott has to like he has to like be closing the door at uh 11 of his\n20:51\nhouse so um God do um I guess we can asked I one\n21:01\none of the unfortunate things about this is that the the window to vote is uh is\n21:06\ncoming up uh quickly um we I do W to I I do want to even\n21:16\nthough you may not be able to stay um I do want to get Adrian and\n21:25\nNelson um and Adrian you've kind of given your sort of your your uh uh your\n21:30\nobjection meaning and I think it was clearly stated that uh that look gimbal\n21:35\nLabs depends on catalist funds funds from that that tax uh is from there so\n21:42\nuh is that sum up the the argument that's one of\n21:49\nmys uh I would have some more but I don't think we have time for that yeah I\n21:55\nknow it's so it's so bad to uh so so Scott before you have to leave and I I\n22:00\njust want to do you want to um Le let's let's get your voice in here uh before\n22:06\nyou have to go on which\n22:13\nside um let's uh yeah what do you think about that and I know that this you know\n22:20\nbecause you know you don't you have a strong opinion for yourself but as gimble Labs uh you know I think it's\n22:26\nreasonable that that that tax comes from do you have anything that that sort of\n22:32\nhelps us understand better that are we seeing that clearly uh that you know that we're really funded by this tax and\n22:38\nthat you know that a vote on no to to keep the tax as it is is is probably\n22:43\nbest for for gimal labs yeah on that I don't know if it's best like I I don't know gimal Labs um\n22:52\nthey're budget where their funds come from or the economy of the uh Stak pool that is operated so\n22:59\nuh but if if indeed if indeed the the treasury is paying for the uh proposals\n23:04\nthat are funded um that I can see the impact on that if they were to decrease\n23:09\nthat um but gimal ABS also isn't the only entity or organization that is also\n23:15\nreceiving funding from the treasury so by and I'm playing Devil's Advocate so\n23:20\nby PL by by voting no because gimal lab's funding gets there is from there\n23:27\nyou're also pretty much giving a pass to every other project that's getting funding whether or not they're efficient\n23:33\nuseful or of the same so\n23:38\nand I as far as gimal abbs goes like I said I I will abstain anyway since I'm a d and I've already placed my vote and\n23:45\njust trying to play Devil's Advocate with the uh justification just mention yep all right and and Sebastian has his\n23:54\nhad his hand up I missed it twice sorry about that Sebastian no no no I prefer to to to\n24:00\nstate something about this this thing of\n24:06\ngimbals has catalyst is the only option to F gimal UPS in when I present my\n24:13\nproposal because I want I have a proposal to present today if we have the\n24:19\ntime but in general term in general terms I I think um it's a fact today but\n24:25\nuh for in that sense we have to move the organization or the this this exercise\n24:33\nto to another scenarios okay yeah thanks yeah I I definitely I definitely\n24:41\nagree um uh that yeah and then uh Simon I see that your hands up yeah I think\n24:49\nthere's\n24:54\num oh you you muted uh sorry yeah I just sat down the\n25:00\ncomputer and unmuted myself on the computer so I heard myself twice um yeah so I just wanted to make one more point\n25:06\nabout it which is I think it's an unfortunate timing to have it right now because everything with the budget is\n25:12\ncoming up I think it would have been better to have raised the question after the budget has gone through or yeah\n25:20\nmaybe before all the the budget craziness yeah I I think I I couldn't\n25:27\nvote any other way other than than no in this case but I can see like maybe in\n25:33\nthe future if it happen if it comes up again I could see myself vote Yes\n25:39\nactually interesting yeah yeah that is interesting and I'm gonna say goodbye to Scott and thank you so much for bringing\n25:46\nthis up and really taking the lead with h the the D role here Scott um it's really really been\n25:52\nincredible um okay uh so Andrew yeah Andrew we haven't heard from you\n25:59\nyou yeah sorry about that I think it was going to be my turn the internet dropped out I was really frustrating um so if\n26:07\nwe're still talking about this vote I'm inclined to go no um my reason is is uh\n26:14\non the face of it that sounds good to be as a Staker that you may get some extra rewards but there's a couple of things\n26:21\nuh I think James last week mentioned made a very good point about it's pretty disingenuous to label it as a t\n26:29\nbecause yeah the money stays in the ecosystem when when that money um gets\n26:35\npaid out to spos we don't know where that goes where that a goes that's fair enough that's\n26:40\nyou know their reward keep propping up the ecosystem but the the AER from the\n26:48\nto stays in the treasury which we as a part of cardano get to choose where\n26:55\nit goes and that's kind of what a lot of this governance is going to be about so to call it attacked I think is is a bit wrong um and then the other thing I look\n27:01\nat is the proponents of this um proposal in the first place seem to be mostly\n27:07\nmultipool operators um I'm going to be careful with my words now I don't want to offend anyone but\n27:15\nuh multipool operators\n27:22\nwell I'm not as keen on the concept of it so um yeah as much as on face it it\n27:28\nwould seem good for me as a Staker to to to vote Yes I think it's all a bit disingenuous so I say no yeah okay um I\n27:40\nNelson Nelson I know that you had something and and we'll extend just a little bit but I definitely want to come\n27:45\nup and we we can make a make a motion or sort of propose and just say hey a yes\n27:51\nor a no and we can do it uh uh we can do it that way I think I feel like that\n27:58\nmight be okay at this at this point but I'll hear from Nels um yeah without talking about my\n28:05\nopinion I think this vote is not going through right because we're not meeting\n28:12\nthe Constitutional thresold for the uh yeah for the Constitutional committee so\n28:19\nI I'm not sure if we are spending good time here or not because I yeah uh we\n28:25\nneed um 67% thre for the vote to go through and three of\n28:32\nthem voted no and one of them voted abstain so I don't think this going\n28:37\nthrough yeah yes uh\n28:43\nSimon and thanks thanks Nelson that is a good point yeah I wanted to just make one\n28:49\nmore comment about the disingenuous thing because I agree totally agree with that when I read that I thought this was\n28:56\nnot not framed well and I think this goes also more importantly I think this goes\n29:02\nto towards the culture that we want to have do we want to have like a political class that frames things like that or do\n29:10\nwe want to have um like a genuine uh fact based discussion right on with the\n29:18\nterms that are that are actually accurate and that we that we should use\n29:24\nhere and TX is not the the name or the the the framing and the the wding that\n29:30\ncomes to mind when I when I think about this yeah I think that's uh I'm glad\n29:36\nthat you mentioned that I'm glad that this is something because when I read this I'm like wait a minute this is just this is um uh a campaign speeches and\n29:46\nand we need to really see we need to have better you know like and is that a\n29:51\nmy my question was is that something that we can do as a community to sort of\n29:56\ncall it out and then re reframe it to where we can really get a sense of what exactly it is\n30:04\num James I see your hands up and and to that point like and picking up from Nelson's question is this worth the time\n30:12\nthis may be an early example of a proposal that we are best\n30:18\nignoring right like voting no is to take it seriously in a certain way not voting\n30:25\nat all is a way of prag a atically recognizing that the threshold is not\n30:30\nbeing met anyway and it's a way of publicly declaring that this is a silly\n30:37\nproposal framed in a particular terms that really don't\n30:43\napply um and so yeah I you know I think it's good to have an active goal of being sure to vote on everything while\n30:51\nalso recognizing that maybe not voting will sometimes be an action in itself\n31:00\nyes so so we've got options yes no abstain and ignore ignore ignore seems\n31:08\ncoming to the surface as a possibility right here right right I in the go ahead\n31:18\njust um what what what happens if\n31:26\num if everyone one ignores it but like a few people is there a threshold\n31:33\nthat needs to be met well you can see right here the the\n31:38\nconstitutionality threshold already won't to be met yeah whether we agree with that or\n31:45\nnot this is a system that works in a certain way and the way the system has\n31:50\nalready resolved this question is that three of seven on the Constitutional\n31:57\ncommittee have already registered a motion that this is\n32:03\nunconstitutional right and so therefore just as pragmatic rational actors in\n32:09\nthis ecosystem how much time do we want to give to this otherwise ridiculous\n32:14\nproposal and we all right all right right and we can go we can be we can\n32:20\nmake a public statement we can post this video wherever we want to right so\n32:26\nthat's an option right and so it's not always going to be passive to not vote it's possible to not vote and say look\n32:34\nwe gave this the time it's worth it's really not worth the time right now I agree with Simon that there's a point in\n32:40\nthe future where a yes vote might make a ton of sense um but right now it's it's\n32:46\na distraction that pulls in a political discourse that only exists in some but\n32:52\nnot all countries and and some people who live in one of those countries countes brought their problems to the\n32:59\ntable and framed it this way right like how much so how much time do we want to give those guys how much do we want to\n33:05\nfacilitate that kind of discourse and I'm glad people already named that here right we don't we can choose as a norm\n33:12\nnot to engage in that way yeah yeah right I was asking more from a d\n33:19\nperspective is there you can also you can see that current result as well and\n33:26\nso what's what's the number of no votes from DS already um yeah no I'm asking is there a\n33:32\nthreshold like if there's only I don't know 5% voting yes and everyone else abstains is gonna go through Yeah well\n33:40\nyeah and and if you saw that happening you would spring into action and you would register a vote but that's not the\n33:47\ncase right now yeah right right okay so with that in mind I think we're ready to\n33:54\nbecause uh you're right and we do have very important business so I and\n34:01\nHarsha what do you think um I think I'm I'm ready to uh uh just to to take a\n34:08\nround and and um propose ignore from the from the gimal grabs gimal Labs\n34:16\nD I'm cool with that yeah okay so this will have a uh let's\n34:25\nhave like a a voting round uh uh do you have an objection to um\n34:32\nignore and I'll go down the line um I I have no objection to uh and uh to to\n34:39\nignore James and then Adrien no\n34:45\nobjections uh Adrian No Object objections let's save the transaction\n34:51\nfee beautiful uh Andrew and then Emanuel yeah no OB from\n34:58\nme Emanuel then Hara yeah I have no\n35:05\nobjection yeah same no objection Martin then\n35:12\nmix he's just Martin just might be listening in I uh I agree yeah mix and mo hey guys\n35:23\nuh yeah I have no objection and I guess uh it would be a good opportunity for\n35:29\nthem to do better yeah yeah yeah yeah for those reasons that we mentioned earlier I definitely I definitely think\n35:35\nokay uh Monique and then Nelson no objection okay perfect thank\n35:41\nyou Nelson then Sebastian yeah I have no objection nice\n35:46\nnice Sebastian then Simon no\n35:54\nobjection S no look at that now we celebrate thank you thank you\n36:00\nvery much for working through that I feel like I feel like that was the process working I'm going to I'm I'm\n36:06\ntapping the uh the celebrate button um thank you so\n36:11\nmuch all right so you know I I think I think\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Which Spaces\n36:18\nthat's beautiful because there's other projects to be done here let's get into which spaces and you know I'd invite you\n36:26\nto sort of move around you know uh shift gears over into um this uh this other uh\n36:35\nCommunity uh uh proposal James is the owner and Source um this as you know is\n36:42\nthe catalyst is our Catalyst funding we have these um this is an\n36:50\ninflow of uh uh of uh of\n36:55\nmonies and that doesn't have our flow in here well the Catalyst fun 13 proposal\n37:01\nwould provide the inflow and this will back outflow from it okay um James do\n37:09\nyou want to uhh take the helm and uh guide us through this I can uh I I'm sharing the screen so I can point us in\n37:15\nthe right direction yeah thanks and so this proposal is pretty well along um we I think we talked about kind\n37:24\nof the driver and and those details and people have a chance to look at it and I'll drop it in the chat right now just\n37:29\nin case people need to read through here is the public\n37:39\nlink um but yeah so the goal here is to um keep public spaces at gimal Labs\n37:48\ngoing um the sort of spaces for example that are gutted when people in power\n37:54\ndecide to give everybody else a tax break and uh privatize public services\n38:00\nbut we'll we'll leave that aside for now um we are in the business of keeping\n38:05\npublic spaces open that's what we do at gimal laabs and what we want to do is\n38:11\nalso be supporting facilitators to get better and better at their craft and the\n38:17\nway we do that is by making sure that we're using some of our budget to fund\n38:22\npeople for facilitating meetings and we have the beginnings of a of a network of people who are\n38:29\npracticing this so for example Harsha and Newman have taken on facilitation of\n38:35\nthis space a few times this year and when when I have the privilege of\n38:41\nhanding it off to them I get to be a participant again which is a role I\n38:46\nreally enjoy playing um and I get to learn a lot um because being a\n38:52\nfacilitator you see everything through a different lens you're on a different Newman you can probably relate to this from today you're on a different kind of\n38:58\nalert that prevents you from thinking through all the ideas clearly because you are serving the rest of the\n39:03\ncommunity and that's a really big deal and so to share this across our growing\n39:10\necosystem and to make sure we're placing value in it that's what this proposal does right it takes the spaces we that\n39:18\nhave emerged at gimal Labs that have evolved to their current state which you can see down below number seven there's\n39:25\na table that name the spaces that we keep going over a closed time frame this\n39:33\nproposal is only about the first half of 2025 running spaces through May and then\n39:43\nactually another thing this proposal kind of um gives us the option to do is\n39:49\nto take some time off after may I do think that some seasons of not having\n39:56\nmeetings but doing maybe deep work or hackathons together is something I would really like to explore maybe in June and\n40:04\nso that's why I I I'm not making any proposal about that formally right now\n40:10\num but at least this proposal ends in May so that we can set the stage to have\n40:15\nsome options for using time differently maybe during some months or seasons of the year um so what you can see in that\n40:22\ntable right we're going to keep running aen live coding on Tuesdays this proposal require re Ires no funding for\n40:28\nthat because that's a separately funded project cardano all things go we just\n40:34\nstarted mix uh facilitated the third session of that yesterday and it's\n40:40\nreally starting to have a flow and a voice I think that that that session got really good reviews from people as we\n40:47\nwere leaving there's this Open Spaces session um speaks for itself this is\n40:55\nwhat we do um and then following this session uh the we just added a gimal ABS\n41:01\nTech standup which kind of toes the line between what what later sessions of\n41:08\nplutus pbl live coding have done in the past right giving anybody a chance to show up bring questions or demos work on\n41:15\nstuff together um and it's a step towards um moving us into a season at\n41:23\ngimal ABS where we are building stuff more often and this is already happening so the esteria work is really running on\n41:31\nits own driven by the people working on that project the plutus pbl maintainers\n41:38\nwork has really stood for itself and as as this continues and\n41:44\nlater if we have time I have a request for proposals for a technical project\n41:49\nthat I would like to just bring to the group and and see if anybody wants to pick it up but as this continues to\n41:56\nhappen and we do have these you know in S3 we would call them circles right\n42:01\nself-organizing circles um something like a weekly standup where people can get together\n42:07\nshow off and ask each other questions I think becomes a really engaging thing and that's why we're trying that\n42:12\nexperiment so with this calendar right here down below you can see an estimate\n42:17\nof how many sessions would run Open Spaces I'd like to make this retroactive to\n42:23\nJanuary um and so this would be funding for January through May total of 18 sessions it says about 18 just because\n42:31\nit might be if if we cancel a few more of them for any number of reasons that would be like the most um all things go\n42:37\nwould max out at 11 sessions Tech standup would max out at 11 sessions so you can see we have about 40 sessions at\n42:46\na proposed rate of 200 Ada for facilitating each one and that's why\n42:52\nthis proposal is asking for 8,000 Ada from the gimal ABS treasury to facilitate these sessions plus a\n43:00\nthousand for just Catalyst reporting itself which is critical this helps people know what we've been doing and\n43:06\nand invites other people into the work a thousand I think it is good to put this\n43:12\naside just for continued R&D about how we report on these things right there's\n43:17\nthe Catalyst reporting that we have to do but how about a th Ada for just\n43:24\nexperimenting with the ways we tell the stories about these spaces to whatever\n43:31\nstakeholders we don't have to decide exactly how to use it but I think this is really good for anybody who wants to\n43:37\npick up kind of that storytelling piece um and then keeping the calendar up to date I can continue to take care of that\n43:44\njust as part of this and then when I brought this proposal last week it did\n43:49\nopen a really good conversation about marketing but just to keep things easy to manage from a proposal perspective I\n43:56\nse seated those notes into a new Doc so we don't have to make marketing the\n44:01\nscope of this proposal just to keep facilitation going uh but I think we\n44:07\nshould flesh out a marketing plan for anybody who's interested in it so those\n44:12\nare the most important updates I just copied the same table if if you're not familiar with linked or synced blocks in\n44:20\nnotion this is a really helpful way you can edit in one place um and it stays the same in the other so this is just a\n44:26\ncop um of the same table that's above so you can read it again when it comes to responsibilities right we just want to\n44:32\nhave facilitators for all of these sessions I think it's okay if there aren't names on them yet like so Tech\n44:39\nstandup you can see in April and May there's nobody assigned to that yet um\n44:45\nthe reason I'm fine keeping it blank is I'm happy to do it but I won't fill in\n44:50\nmy name until giving somebody else the chance to take it on um and Newman Hara\n44:56\nif you guys become the default for Open Spaces but other people have the option\n45:01\nof jumping in how would you feel about that I wouldn't mind that necessarily um\n45:08\nwe definitely are going to do uh next week and uh the week after that will be\n45:14\nthe uh but yeah we wouldn't I don't yeah we'll have to talk it with with over with ARA but yeah that could that could\n45:20\nwork and I like that having um we could say this is the default host um because\n45:27\none of the nice things about a giant Community is that you know things happen and and it's good to have people to fill\n45:32\nin and those Fillin spots can lead into the more default post so\n45:38\nyeah cool thank you yeah that's exactly how I'm thinking of it and it it echoes to what Scott said about writing the\n45:46\nprevious proposal we were talking about the DP vote like somebody has to do that first step right but but he made it\n45:53\nclear he didn't want to be seen as wanting to express a strong opinion he was trying to get a conversation started\n46:00\nand in a similar way a default host is there as a service not because they're\n46:06\ntrying to grab a rooll and keep it from anybody else but because it's good to know like okay if nobody else steps up\n46:12\nhere's who's going to do this but we can keep practicing offering the option to\n46:18\nother people and and eventually people do step up yeah y I think that that's and that that terminology I think is\n46:24\nreally great so responsibilities that's why these responsibilities aren't fully fleshed\n46:31\nout but I hope that makes sense to folks that they they are fleshed out but they're left open to keep that door open\n46:39\num and yeah potential risks I think it's worth it just to name right we're uncertain about the impact of these\n46:46\nspaces and some of it is you know some of it you could compare to planting a tree and and you're not going to see its\n46:51\nfruit for a long time obviously that's that's a nice story we can tell ourselves if we're not sure about our\n46:57\nimpact um but we we we maybe want to start looking for ways to decide whether\n47:04\nthese spaces are are delivering value and that's a really hard thing to do um and\n47:12\nso that's why it's good just to list some risks and mitigations just to say look we have questions we're we're we\n47:17\ndon't know the long-term import of this um but at least by reminding each other\n47:24\nof that we can stay open and and dedicated to like asking those questions so yeah I think that's I think\n47:31\nthis is pretty complete um and yeah I can pass it off to Newman to facilitate the process yeah so now the first thing\n47:39\nand if you recall our process the first round that we do is to and we can\n47:45\npopcorn style this it's like do you have questions that clarify not an opinion\n47:51\nwhether this should be funded or not necessarily at this stage but just uh there's something that uh we call it\n47:57\nclarifying questions and it's if you have in you have an informational\n48:03\nrequest of James the owner or the community at large uh harsh do that does\n48:10\nthat match where we're at in the process now sounds good yes yes\n48:16\nokay so and we'll do this popcorn style so if you have uh a clarifying question\n48:22\nuh just uh you can just jump off mute and and uh and speak or put it in the\n48:28\nchat arsha will mind the\n48:33\nchat okay so people feel we've done this we\n48:39\ndid we've done this process once before so we we we did this or they fund\n48:46\n12 um uh uh project Catalyst uh uh sustain\n48:53\nand maintain gimbal Labs proposal so it's should be pretty familiar\n48:58\neverybody's being quiet I'm feeling like it's pretty\n49:04\nestablished I do have I have a question and that is\n49:11\nprerequisites so is this a prerequisite for the\n49:17\nfacilitator James yes I forgot that I even added that here so yeah the idea\n49:22\nhere is um we are in we're moving all of these projects one by one into\n49:30\nandamio and so we could play with this concept like what what would somebody\n49:36\nhave had to do first before they could join as a facilitator for one of these\n49:44\nspaces right um and I don't think we have to fully answer that question now\n49:50\num it'll be an exciting moment if somebody we've never met before shows up\n49:56\nand says hey can I facilitate next week um I think we can save that question for\n50:01\nwhen it happens right for now anybody who's expressed interest in\n50:07\nfacilitation is at least known to others because they've showed up for a certain number of meetings so far um and so I\n50:13\nthink we can leave it like that and then on the technical side we've talked about this in the dev space the last few weeks\n50:19\nand this will be a continued thing um where we talk about like what are the prcts to joining any project that's\n50:27\napproved here but I don't think it has to be the scope of this proposal right right um yeah the for\n50:35\ninstance you wouldn't want somebody that doesn't have uh Tech and development\n50:40\nexperience you know hosting the the the tech standup meaning that the real value\n50:46\nin that is having an experienced person there to sort of guide uh I always like to think of them as uh computer lab\n50:54\nattendance like those guys knew so much stuff and if you just be friends with them order a pizza you're in you're\n51:03\nin uh you know one of the things about this facilitation that we're doing is uh\n51:08\nthe facilitators collective uh actually has a course and it's something that I've completed um okay any other\n51:17\nquestions um I can show\n51:23\nthe oh wait oh it's up at the top there is a budget workshop and so one of the\n51:28\nthings about when you read these you know you can really you can really go\n51:33\ndown and ask like go to the requirements and what it's asking um and and the\n51:40\nbudget is a big one um so in that vein I created this\n51:45\nspreadsheet and it is [Music]\n51:52\nhere and is the total budget well anyway this you know we can but so\n52:01\nwe're going to we're offloading the marketing and so this gets down to\n52:08\nzero um and so we're gonna this is a $10,000 um a 10,000 Ada um\n52:16\nrequest right okay\n52:22\nokay yeah I feel uh let's H let's Okay Bon\n52:31\nyeah respect to the pr Rex I think we can we can lower the the\n52:38\nbarrier asking for H taking the specific model the facilit the new facilitator\n52:44\nwant to want to facilitate right because it's really complicated to to push the\n52:51\npeople to take the whole L to gain that spot facility in\n52:57\nthings um we can okay maybe you want to I don't know you but the thing is I\n53:04\ndon't know you but you can you can participate so at least take the model that you want to\n53:10\nfacilitate and it's let's see from that right\n53:16\nright yeah yeah\n53:23\nexcellent paraa I think that our next our next process is are we to\n53:33\nOB objections and concerns yeah oh yeah uh does anyone have um concerns or\n53:42\nwant to frame the discussion here uh James is the owner and I'll and\n53:50\nI'll go down the line here Adrian and Andrew any\n53:57\nuh like a concern it's like anything that pops up sounds good\n54:03\nto me okay excellent thank you Andrew anything that's popping popping up to you that you want to\n54:09\nverbalize uh no no um I think this is a fair proposal and uh yeah shout out to\n54:16\neveryone who contributes around here and um you get uh yeah it's great place to\n54:22\nbe around nice um Emanual and then\n54:28\nHara concerns and objections no I have no objection to\n54:36\nthis uh because I was about to ask if this is the first time this is coming up\n54:42\nuh and uh I think said it was I think I\n54:47\nthink he said it was done in the last uh yeah it was done in the last F round so\n54:53\nyes uh so this is the way to about it yes no objection perfect perfect um harsh and\n55:02\nthen manual yeah uh no objections yeah uh Martin and then next thanks thanks uh\n55:10\nMara uh no objections cool mix and then Monique yep\n55:16\nno objection either okay cool Monique no\n55:22\nobjections thanks Nelson and then Sebastian no\n55:31\nOB no objections okay Simon so Simon asked\n55:37\nthat he had stepped away so this basically is our object objection round and it and it's where you know if you\n55:44\nhave any strong opinion um about whether we ex we adopt this proposal um uh this\n55:51\nis where you would would voice it it can also be a concern it's just like oh well maybe the this part needs to be uh\n56:00\nchanged yeah it's okay I don't I don't want to waste anyone's time on this we\n56:05\ngot all right all right I love it um yeah I think that we can um adopt this\n56:14\nproposal and I uh this proposal is adopted no objections all around hey\n56:20\ncelebration time I definitely want to get a screen something that celebrates\n56:26\nhere you know what I mean the T icon can only take you so far it's really it's it it\n56:32\nused to be so cool you know but now um and we can um oh oh wait a minute wait a\n56:39\nminute this is a little more so where we\n56:45\ngo here and we move this is it we move it right now\n56:53\nthis is satisfying wa wait don't we oh no we can do it here status\n57:00\nthis one two in progress and it goes down\n57:11\nhere right this one okay progress\n57:18\nhooray okay now so we're shifting gears again um oh we're going to move this\n57:26\nwant to backlog this one goes backlog done I I\n57:31\nthought it was it was we yeah we go to done yeah we go to\n57:37\ndone okay hooray all right that's our celebrate thing can we drag it you can\nA quick check, Proposal: Gimbalabs Marketing Plan.\n57:44\ncan we go like this you can okay I don't want to try it live on TV I think the uh the destination has to be open but yeah\n57:50\nit should work oh okay cool um now this one draft of the gimbal Labs marketing\n57:58\nplan now this one I don't think there's been progress on this one since last week I didn't\n58:04\nhave time to Fork it until today um okay but yeah we can Seb do you want to pick\n58:10\nup the marketing one now or should we save that one in the planning or\n58:18\nbacklog yeah I think I I think this guy and Shaggy Shaggy one wants to be in the\n58:27\nThe Proposal that I don't know we can we can ping him with a link to this yeah\n58:34\nyeah okay is he in\n58:40\nthe is he is oh not yet not yet he's not in\n58:47\nokay um but just taking a brief look at this one uh this one is the gimbal ABS marketing\n58:55\nplan and remember we took out some budget from the witch spaces into the marketing which I think makes a lot of\n59:00\nsense um so uh there is a lot that goes into marketing and I know Simon you has\n59:07\nhand up go ahead Simon yeah so I've been thinking about\n59:13\nuh about working on this for chimber labs with a friend of\n59:18\nmine um yeah but I'm not best friends with shagy so\n59:25\nI'm not sure if that is a good option anymore to be honest you don't\n59:31\nnecessarily only have to work with best friends you can work with everyone example I was gonna give I was\n59:38\ngonna tell har a bad joke I always joke around with har but do you have a a is there you guys are do well\n59:48\nyeah I I think yeah I I tried not not to get\n59:53\ninvolved with him I I think yeah I've been working with him on the uh\n59:58\nmarketing working group in intersect and it didn't it only hurt me I don't want\n1:00:04\nto be involved with him anymore yeah yeah however that's all I'm gonna say in this case I think we\n1:00:11\ncan you can prepare a proposal in the same way in the same area right in the same with the same topic and as\n1:00:18\nCommunity you can decide okay this this proposal has more sense to it's more aligned with the primary R of gimbal\n1:00:25\nabsur or shag's proposal or something like that this is a good this I think this is a good situation because we have\n1:00:32\nseveral people interested on on participating the marketing site but\n1:00:38\nwith a different different approach right that's valid so I invite you to to\n1:00:44\ntake the present a proposal so if if I were to do that I would need some um\n1:00:50\ninformation about the goals and the general strategy of chimol labs where\n1:00:55\ncan of I can I can help you I can have you har I don't know you can also I can\n1:01:00\nmake some notes right we can open a document a public document in in Ocean\n1:01:06\nand start adding adding some points there for everybody that wants to to be\n1:01:12\na proposal around marketing all right okay so I get I get in contact with you Sebastian and um you can refer me to the\n1:01:19\nnecessary information yeah I will open the I will open the document and I ping\n1:01:26\nyou when when this is ready and also I will ping to to\n1:01:32\nshaggi to when the document is ready right and everyone of you can can offer\n1:01:38\nthe do this their thing I don't know if if any of you guys\n1:01:44\nhave of girls have some some objection in the approach I think it's the most\n1:01:50\nmost the most fair for everybody yeah and now so this is draft\n1:01:56\nlike a marketing plan which I know that Simon has like a good amount of experience on based on his work with\n1:02:02\nintersect and some other things um but it also is fulfilling the responsibility\n1:02:08\nfor things that we've got written down here uh bringing people to the session\n1:02:13\num that that the that there's life and action on the social networks that we\n1:02:19\nhave a consistent open and live gimbal lab spaces um establishing workflows\n1:02:26\nlike a set of tasks and and times to do things as far as our promotion uh\n1:02:31\nannouncements in web hooks like calendaring um you know we talked about\n1:02:38\nsort of the automated tools um Twitter spaces uh just representing uh gimbal\n1:02:44\nlabs in the in the market uh uh reporting and tracking metrics so what I\n1:02:50\nsee is that there's actually a big ecosystem uh you know a department so uh\n1:02:56\nand it's in a decentralized way meaning that you know if you were to you know\n1:03:01\nthere may be something that you can do even you don't have to work really uh so closely with others um for instance this\n1:03:09\nMedia Kit maintenance the that feels like it's a a periodic thing uh as\n1:03:16\nopposed to um like a operational uh weekly maintenance of\n1:03:22\nmaking announcements which is basically what Sebastian does now um but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I I\n1:03:29\ndefinitely think there's a place for uh opport there are opportunities here\n1:03:37\num so Sebastian or Simon is your hands still up\n1:03:45\nor yeah uh what are the next actions here you know this it feels like we need\n1:03:52\nmore um more work to make it more\n1:03:57\ndefined is that is that a in fact in fact I don't have to we\n1:04:04\ndon't have to open a new document we can we can use this to add some notes at the\n1:04:09\nend of the at the end of the of the do okay\n1:04:15\nyeah yeah so we'll keep this one we'll keep this one in uh\n1:04:22\nconsent and uh uh could we in the 20 10 10 to 15 minutes we've got\n1:04:30\nleft uh which of these would be good to attack\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Gimbalabs Incubator and Accelerator. Phase 1: Front End Support.\n1:04:36\nnext i' like to share something about the galap in Creator that's a proposal\n1:04:42\nthat I want to to present today excellent that is that is yeah go\n1:04:48\nahead yeah let's do it okay this proposal is aligned with um what we are\n1:04:54\ndiscussing just a few moments about the the only\n1:05:00\nthe finance the funding sources of gimbals this is a a think an idea that I\n1:05:05\nhave had and I I I'm sure that I I was not the only one trying to\n1:05:14\nto to identify some another sources funding sources for for game Bops right\n1:05:22\nand this is this proposal is based on conversations that I I had the\n1:05:28\nopportunity to to have with ex students and ex dep students in in that took some\n1:05:38\nuh some some classes and lessons in the in\n1:05:43\nthe spaces in the gal spaces and their level of satisfaction H\n1:05:50\nER takes them to think that H seriously on make some donations to to galops in\n1:05:59\nexchange of the the pro the the activities educational activities we make here so and today we have we are in\n1:06:07\nthis ecosystem where the incubation and acceleration is taking a really good a really good first\n1:06:14\nstage and this is I think I think this is This falls into the the expertise of\n1:06:22\ngimbal UPS as Community organization so the thing is um building\n1:06:30\nincubator is a really big exercise it's a complex cace like that and in in that\n1:06:37\nsense we can H start for step by step um\n1:06:43\nidentifying um urgent Necessities in the ecosystem in the developer ecosystem and\n1:06:49\nstart to support some in in some way those kind of Necessities one of the the\n1:06:55\nthe most clearness needs in the uh needs\n1:07:00\nis the the frontend front end development the the the projects and startups in the ecosystem needs urgently\n1:07:08\nsome kind of support in the front side right and they have the budget they have the budget to to to support\n1:07:14\nto to to fund those kind of some kind of\n1:07:20\num um assistance and support in that way right but we have zero\n1:07:26\nH dep force in in in that front in that layer of the developer stack so my idea\n1:07:34\nwith this proposal is to um um start building this idea of uh\n1:07:41\nmaking galops an incubator and an accelerator\n1:07:46\num based on and and the first step the first step is to build a a a collective\n1:07:53\nI I call that in this in this in this proposal Collective Collective of frontend developers not expert\n1:08:00\ndevelopers just gimbal apps members that have some kind of a experience some kind\n1:08:07\nof a domain in the area of front end development sufficient to support a a\n1:08:15\ncardano projects right and we know cardano projects are really not too complex projects in some\n1:08:23\nway they they are complex in the back end but in the front end they are as as\n1:08:28\nusual as the web to web to U projects um so my proposal is first\n1:08:35\nstart taking a steps into build that kind of circle that would be would be a new Circle um a basic Circle a basic\n1:08:43\nsale of developers from developers gimbal UPS members that can provide some\n1:08:49\nkind of support on that right I was thinking for example on Hara Hara has has has experience in ux development I\n1:08:58\nwas thinking on Newman that has some kind of I don't know I'm I'm just I can\n1:09:03\nhave a a rudimentary knowledge about you guys about your experience but I think you have some kind of exper expertise on\n1:09:12\nwhat is around uh front end development around ux experience and all that stuff\n1:09:19\nand I think we can use that and and and on only talking about just\n1:09:26\nboth of you guys but this this is an invitation to everybody that has some\n1:09:31\nkind of expertise in front of development basic no matter the the the\n1:09:39\nlevel yeah an invitation uh so that's the first start building the the circle the circle the\n1:09:47\nfront and circle with this approach of a supporting front end ER supporting\n1:09:53\ncardano projects in the area of incubation right of incub of supporting supporting projects uh in the\n1:10:02\ndetails of the proposal I invite you to read The Proposal in these details you can see uh first is the calling of the\n1:10:10\nof the members interested in in in in in be part of the of the circle the second\n1:10:15\nis around this the the these first um sessions that allow to start clarifying\n1:10:22\nprocedures and uh driver mapping in general general terms and the thing we\n1:10:27\nhave a a a rabit test rabit know I'm saying that really well I proposed\n1:10:35\nandamio because andamio first is a I I I gave there the the the reasons why\n1:10:42\nandamio is a good Prospect to serve to this ex this first exercise as the the a\n1:10:50\nproject test that can can resist all our experiments around frontend development\n1:10:58\nsupport um in among those merits that I think are valuable first is was is a\n1:11:05\ncompany funded by many of the instructors and and and and teachers\n1:11:11\nthat voluntarily have provide services to galops for for\n1:11:17\nyears and I think it's that makes them a\n1:11:22\napt to receive some kind of support and currently andamio is supporting\n1:11:28\ngimbals in in in provide in providing the courses the several courses that we\n1:11:35\nare today h delivering to the students and the cardano ecosystem in general in\n1:11:41\nour Open Spaces I have to say I have to say this H this prop this this whole\n1:11:48\nproposal is align with the primary driver of the of gimbal because the primary driver talks about\n1:11:56\nbuilding spaces building new spaces right and we have in in in today we have\n1:12:03\ninternal and and and and really well known spaces but internally at kind\n1:12:11\nof a in our wellknown wellknown uh radar\n1:12:18\nbut I think we must to start testing the boundaries of these limits of our usual\n1:12:25\nradar and start to think on expanding our expanding our\n1:12:30\nour our area of action in terms of spaces I think we can go and start to\n1:12:36\nbuilding spaces outside of the of our traditional uh our traditional ER\n1:12:45\ntraditional field right and start to build in a kind of pipeline between our\n1:12:50\ninternal and well-known spaces and these spaces that are FOC fused on incubating\n1:12:56\nand supporting supporting projects we can build there a kind of pipeline that can communicate both intentions right\n1:13:04\nimagine for example a proposer or a a entrepreneur a cardan entrepreneur on an\n1:13:10\nN entrepreneur or a Solan entrepreneur etc etc that wants to start building on\n1:13:16\ncardano right he can come here to envelops and start taking the the the\n1:13:21\nour our sessions and then they can go to our our circles in charge of supporting\n1:13:30\nprojects in a specific areas in this case front end but with time depending of how this experiment goes we can start\n1:13:37\nsupporting projects in other areas in backing areas specific more more more\n1:13:43\nmore in technically intense areas so yeah that's right um I think we we\n1:13:51\nhave okay that's that general idea if we go to the scroll down the impact the\n1:13:58\nimpact talks about that uh we can start we can K starting our efforts\n1:14:05\nthrough a a gimbal UPS incubator right and as a gimbals incubator we can have\n1:14:12\naccess not only to the Catalyst funds but also to intersect funds but also to\n1:14:17\ndonations from the developers direct donations to gimbal apps from H the\n1:14:23\ndevelopers that receive support we can charge to those to those projects if\n1:14:30\nthey have the they have the they have received for example a catalis proposal or they have they have a catalis\n1:14:36\nproposal or an intersect proposal in course we can we can there in the scenario we have several ways of getting\n1:14:43\nfunds and getting income and from years we have had that g in gimbal apps this\n1:14:49\nidea of gimbal up Solutions where we provide H the project services in in\n1:14:55\ndifferent areas right this front endend Collective can be the first of the whole\n1:15:01\narray of services we can provide to the to the people\n1:15:06\nyes uh so I read through the through the proposal and I'm curious as to what is\n1:15:13\nthe connection between anio and I think they're providing 10,000 data right did\n1:15:19\nI get that right yeah we have a proposed as uh as you know in in the section uh resources\n1:15:27\nresources I'm asking 10,000 Adas for funding for for funding two deps for h\n1:15:35\ntwo months the ration okay so this is a proposal that goes to uh anio right no\n1:15:42\nthis is a proposal that goes to gimbal ABS I I'm asking for an funding funding\n1:15:47\nfrom gimbals no from galops to fund these two deps and these two deps will start to to work with d te what is the\n1:15:55\nrational behind that um I see the the the rational is\n1:16:03\nU galab andamio is a as many other\n1:16:08\nprojects in the ecosystem has some specific needs in the front end u in the\n1:16:14\nfront end side andamio and imelaps has a kind of relationship and they can provide in the\n1:16:21\nshort and in the medium term some kind of mutual service Services if gimbal apps has success in the in providing the\n1:16:30\nthe services to the companies that they have to to to to they have to provide\n1:16:38\nall that benefit will go to to to the collective Collective\n1:16:44\nrecognition right and so what is the um how does it combine with the with the\n1:16:54\nsorry is an accelerator the with the with the overall idea of building the\n1:16:59\nthe capacity of of um front end developers and\n1:17:05\necosystem yes the the main goal of this of this of this proposal is build is to\n1:17:10\nbuild our own capacity of provide services to other projects galops in\n1:17:16\nthis case andamio is one of the projects that that we have at hand in this moment and they I have to say I'm part of gamia\n1:17:24\nand many others here are part of and right so we are available to\n1:17:32\ncoordinate the activities necessary to provide the\n1:17:37\nexpertise ER H to the developers all the\n1:17:42\nthe the space that they need to exper the gimbal apps deps will need to\n1:17:48\nexperiment in in this clients or this incubation relationship\n1:17:58\nright so is the idea that the two developers um would would help with the\n1:18:08\nincubator or like I'm just trying to connect the resources that are going in there with\n1:18:14\nthe overall goal right like how how does it connect to the\n1:18:21\nincubator yeah um okay if you want you can put the\n1:18:28\nclarifying questions in the document and I can I can start to to to to answer those questions but in a nutshell uh in\n1:18:37\na nutshell this uh this funded developers from gimbal\n1:18:43\nABS that will work with andamio um will attend the andamio will\n1:18:49\nbe the first client of gimbals in this in this in this in this incubation\n1:18:57\nwork uh from that we will gather data about what's happening how how we go the\n1:19:02\nprocess how the process work work in and start to take some decisions about it uh\n1:19:10\nmy invitation is to just read the proposal the entire proposal and just\n1:19:16\nplease put the there the objections and questions you could have\n1:19:27\nyes and uh thank you yeah that's uh that's great Sebastian um and I will put in a little section for clarifying\n1:19:34\nquestions and then let's uh let's quickly do a round of uh this is sort of\n1:19:40\na response like it's not for objections or or but it's like clarifying questions\n1:19:46\nor uh just uh your feeling um let's we can make it short we do I do want to\n1:19:51\ngive us a few minutes to sign out or to check out um let's start up at the top of my list uh James and then we'll skip\n1:19:59\nover Sebastian and uh Andrew um yeah I'm excited to see how\n1:20:05\nthis proposal evolves and it reminds me of other things we've done in the past right trying a new pattern um to see\n1:20:12\nwhat products it might emerge so yeah I'm excited thanks Seb for writing\n1:20:17\nit Well Done uh Andrew and then Adrian uh yeah uh think that's an\n1:20:25\ninteresting proposal actually um yeah um sorry I've not really got\n1:20:30\nmuch else to say on it I'm just I'm interested uh yeah I like I like the sound of it yeah it all sounds positive\n1:20:36\nso we'll see how it goes and uh Adrian and then Emanuel\n1:20:44\nsounds like a really interesting proposal thanks\n1:20:49\nup and Emanuel then Hara\n1:20:54\nyeah uh it's it's a very great uh proposal yeah yeah uh it's uh we know\n1:21:00\nhow uh you know um on K development there's been a lot of backend Works\n1:21:07\ngoing on and I think this is uh this is uh a very interesting proposal and\n1:21:13\nobviously I was uh I've been uh so much interested uh but uh I tried front end\n1:21:20\nbut I think I'm feeling in front end uh pretty early bad so yes uh yes it's a\n1:21:25\nvery nice yes excellent thanks Manuel thanks I have I just want to say my intention in\n1:21:32\nthis session was just share the proposal I was not aspiring to okay get the the\n1:21:38\napproval today but the first step is to share my my my intentions here and\n1:21:44\nthat's it yeah uh yeah for sure for sure um but let's I I I'm loving this these\n1:21:50\nthese uh coming up with these questions um Harsha and then um\n1:21:55\nMar so uh I actually was speaking to Newman about this like my initial\n1:22:01\nthoughts are that the way we think about front end in the age of AI is going to\n1:22:07\nbe different I think Theory becomes extremely important so I think if we focus on Theory the rest of it can be\n1:22:15\nautomated that's just my opinion yeah\n1:22:20\nyeah um okay thank you Hara that's a great Point Martin and then\n1:22:26\nmix yeah do stuff great do stuff love\n1:22:34\nit and mix and then Nelson yeah I do agree with this\n1:22:39\nproposal actually the the idea of uh being incubator or supporting developers\n1:22:47\nor even creating a Marketplace for developers uh or you know being kind of\n1:22:53\njob shadowing something we talk throughout several years of running\n1:22:58\ngimbal ABS about all these ideas um so yeah let's try maybe this is a year that\n1:23:06\ngimal ABS uh will use its community so that the community will get\n1:23:14\nbenefits in different ways that we were doing in uh past so sure I completely\n1:23:23\nsupport uh proposal such proposal and also uh I can see that we have other\n1:23:30\nneeds in the ecosystem so sure it's a front end but smart contract developer\n1:23:35\nback end or even system design so there are peoples out there that uh they have\n1:23:41\nsome ideas but they cannot conceptualize that because they don't have the enough\n1:23:46\ntechnical uh ideas or I don't know technical capability to you know\n1:23:52\njust uh think that idea into this blockchain space or\n1:23:57\neven cardano I mean they have something in ethereum they don't have and actually\n1:24:02\nI've seen many proposal Catalyst proposal that they have lacking these people and they seek these people so\n1:24:10\nyeah I think this would be a great start for doing that uh\n1:24:16\nhopefully uh we we will see great uh and I don't know like great proposal as\n1:24:22\noffspring of these proposal perfect thank you mix and Simon uh we we\n1:24:30\njust have one minute left um I do know that we we kind of have a weird hard\n1:24:35\nstop because we go to the next uh Tech standup but I do want to close this one out so Simon maybe you want to mention\n1:24:42\nyour question real quick and then we'll and then we'll close it\n1:24:47\nout or we can we can yeah yeah just still a bit unclear about how to\n1:24:55\ndevelopers uh working on theam website will help build a front end\n1:25:02\nincubator but yeah yeah okay um and Sebastian let's uh if uh let's answer\n1:25:11\nthat question on the um on the notion and this will be like a little teaser um\n1:25:18\ntoh come back to this proposal and see uh how it's answered in the future\n1:25:23\nbecause we are at time um yeah right and I just want to say I I agree with like\n1:25:29\nwe do need froment developers I also see it in our team and I think like when I\n1:25:35\nwas at the at the convention I heard from I think two other teams actually they would need from developers so it is\n1:25:42\nyeah it is great to hear that you guys are doing something about that for sure for\n1:25:48\nsure cool um harsh uh uh\n1:25:54\nthanks Sebastian Harsha any uh any last words have we forgotten anything or are we ready to shut down no I I thought\nFinal words and closing.\n1:26:01\ntoday was like the most efficient Open Spaces we've went through like so much so that was great yeah it's all you man\n1:26:07\nit's all you it's all you you don't you have no paraa is like the duck he's the duck\n1:26:14\nfeet under the duck I'm the duck I'm the top of the duck paraa is the bottom of the duck I maybe I don't\n1:26:20\nknow there's just too many things that rhyme with duck\n1:26:26\nall right y'all um I am G to hang up my hat and we'll start in on the tech standup I don't do we go to we don't go\n1:26:32\nto a different one I think we just we take a little break generally uh you guys have been at it for a while now and\n1:26:39\nthen we'll start up stay right here do people should we take a 49 or 14 minute break any anybody feel\n1:26:48\nstrong way like the only even number is four so I'll pick four four minute break oh my\n1:26:54\ngod oh on a 9 minute break let start at 1210 10 after all right 10 after 10\n1:27:00\nafter yeah we'll pick it up at 10 after this hour so nine minutes from now uh we'll get going I'm G to stop this\n1:27:06\nrecording um and yeah see you soon everybody thanks everybody Bute",

    "content": "Intro and how Open Spaces works\n0:02\nhello hello hello thank you for joining us uh you have just tuned in to the\n0:08\nMarch 13th edition of the gimbal labs open spaces uh community meeting this\n0:14\nmeeting is open to everyone uh we're glad that you joined us I'm going to give you a little rundown of what we do\n0:20\nhere uh typically every Thursday around this time which is 14 something\n0:28\nUTC um possibly and uh we are a\n0:34\ncommunity of Learners and typically we're building\n0:40\nand doing little our projects but on Thursdays we sort of put on our administrator hats and we\n0:48\ndo I wouldn't it's governance but uh it's uh we we uh work through our\n0:55\nprojects and we kind of get into the executive function we do a consent decision making process based Loosely on\n1:03\nthe S3 sociocracy 3.0 model and there is a notion board that\n1:12\nI'm going to share right now or uh Hara oh I'm I'm facilitating my name is\n1:19\nNewman uh I'm co- facilitating uh with Hara say hello Harsha\n1:25\nhey right hey Harsha I'm GNA share my screen\n1:30\nand I wonder if uh let's see we'll go through our agenda for today and the agenda is is\n1:40\nbased on these projects and this notion board can everybody see the notion\n1:47\nboard yes okay perfect\n1:53\num this is sort of how we manage things here in gimbal labs and\n2:00\nuh there are proposals anybody is welcome to create a proposal um the the\n2:06\nprojects look like this when they come off of the boiler plate C out of the\n2:11\npress um it's a title and all this sort of stuff you can just write in your idea\n2:17\nin this format and it goes into a uh a pipeline starts with these\n2:23\nproposals um and then it goes to sort of planning a backlog of ones that are are\n2:30\nare sort of on the back burner and then today we go to this community review and\n2:36\nconsent that's what we're here for and so this is our um this is our agenda for\n2:45\ntoday to go through some of these proposals and one of the cool things you can do\n2:52\nin uh in uh in noce is you can move things\n2:58\naround and so this is our idea for today is to talk about this first one uh the\n3:04\nwitch spaces January through June 2025 this one is important uh harsh you want\n3:09\nto explain why this one is important for today absolutely so uh for f-13 sustain\n3:17\nand maintain gimal Labs proposal uh we submitted the first Milestone and we submitted the WID spaces proposal as one\n3:24\nof the things that was consented on but the reviewers were very specific about\n3:31\nwhere the consent was uh and I have to answer to them so I was thinking we could get to the consent one way or the\n3:37\nother and then we can submit it to the review so that we can get through Milestone one and get the payment and\n3:43\ndistribute it to whoever needs it yeah perfect perfect and it's basically and I\n3:50\ncan pull that up but it it basically the Milestone reviewers was saying hey there's some a few specific things and I\n3:57\nremember one of those was who uh will cons who will commit to host and\n4:02\nfacilitate these these spaces uh in our next in then in the next uh few months\n4:10\nis that right\n4:15\nyeah um okay so that's the one that we're going to start first so I'm giving you sort of the agenda and then we're\n4:22\ngoing to talk about then we can decide whether we want\n4:27\nto go through this uh this marketing plan uh which kind of was a\n4:35\nspinoff of this wi spaces because we we were we thought that the the marketing\n4:41\nitself should have its own own proposal uh and then something that is uh\nGimbalabs DRep vote on “Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%”. Final vote: abstain.\n4:47\nsomething that I've really focused on this week is this um the the DP vote as you know gimal\n4:57\nLabs is also a DP so a uh our community is a community of learners but we're\n5:02\nalso a constituency and vote as a as a DP and the in the cardano governance I\n5:09\ndo want to call out and ask Scott um I he took the initiative um uh and is\n5:19\nfocused on if you don't know Scott ratio um he is he is his own D and he's\n5:26\nfocused in on on the on Community governance um and he went through this\n5:33\nuh proposal format and drafted um some great things the things that I want to\n5:39\nhighlight are the pros and cons and this is where we could have a good\n5:45\ndiscussion uh around this um\n5:51\nproposal uh all right so that is by way of agenda there two hands up uh new adri\n6:00\nand Sebastian sorry oh okay um Adrian Adrian yeah go ahead wouldn't it\n6:08\nwouldn't it make more sense to um have the vote proposal first because SC has\n6:13\nto drop off in 20 minutes so we wouldn't make much sense\n6:19\nto discuss a proposal where the owner is not present yeah that's true yeah that's true um we\n6:27\nhad we well actually it does actually that does make sense if we want to discuss that for the next 20 minutes\n6:32\nbecause because then we'll just we'll have a hard stop at 11 when Scott takes off um how do you feel about\n6:40\nthat sounds good to me yeah actually that does sound good um uh and let's uh\n6:48\nlet's begin that discussion now all right\n6:55\nso has everyone does every can everyone one can they see my screen or is uh who\n7:02\nhas not seen this proposal or does not know anything about it the first part of\n7:07\nthe consent decisionmaking process uh and it sort of looks like\n7:14\nthis oh boy um uh is basically reading and\n7:21\nunderstanding this uh what the vote is all about um is anybody\n7:27\nunclear I mean who who has some some questions about what this governance\n7:32\naction is about uh I I don't know what the treasury tax is so Scott if you\n7:38\ncould just give us like a a basic summary about what treas tax is and how\n7:44\nit affects like the everyday cardo user that'd be really awesome oh man that'd be great yeah my understanding on the\n7:52\ntax that I believe is T is actually to in the uh um in the parameters for cardano and\n7:59\nit's supposedly a tax that goes to the treasury from all transaction fees and also I believe from the reserve the\n8:07\ncardono reserve that's released at um three I guess it's 3/10 of whatever the\n8:13\nremaining uh Reserve is is released every every epic and so 20 so it's it's 20% goes to\n8:23\ninto the treasury essentially 80% of of rewards goes out to the spos and then that's\n8:30\ndistributed to the to the stakers um through the through those that stake to\n8:36\nthe spos as rewards um now cardono Foundation wrote a white\n8:42\npaper on it and they claim that it's closer to 32 and a half to\n8:47\n35% um but then also in the same breath cardano actually found the proposal\n8:54\nunconstitutional so um that's it I mean if you have any other questions on I'm not expert expert on tow I did my own\n9:00\nresearch on it and Tred to come up with my own formulas and models to help determine how it would impact cardano\n9:06\nbut that's much harder than I anticipated I'm sorry I just wanted to\n9:12\nask about that study that you're referring to or what do you mean with it's closer to do you mean the tax\n9:19\nitself is closer to 30% yes that's what that's what cardano\n9:24\nFoundation is stating in their white paper I me I can I can dig it up and put a link to it in theuh chat\n9:30\nyeah if you have it that would be amazing sure give me a second I'll get it to you excellent and so so that's a\n9:38\nthat's an important question to ask about like what what is this what is this tax and where does it come from\n9:44\nwhen you read the the the governance action material here\n9:53\num it can give you some some clue as to where it is but it does require some uh\n10:00\nsome thought and I know that that uh that Scott as a d uh you know has his\n10:06\nown opinion and everybody has their opinion uh and I think I think that Scott was thinking of voting yes but I\n10:15\nin the Discord we we heard from Adrian who had a strong um opinion as well and\n10:22\nso I wanted to see if Adrien could uh could come up and sort of you know help\n10:29\nto help us to understand the proposal um from that perspective so the treasury um\n10:37\nfunds are going into to developers or yeah there are for um yeah building the\n10:44\nkadano protocol and also to Catalyst and I think as G gims we definitely cannot\n10:53\nvote uh yes to cut the rate because all our funds are coming from that treasury\n10:58\nmore or less it wouldn't make sense to yeah cut ourself our own funds\n11:07\noff right I mean I kind of feel like I think that that's sort of I mean does\n11:16\nthat let's see uh because this is where this is where catalyst is funded with\n11:21\nthis with this 20% of the of the Dow\n11:27\nexactly um okay Simon has his hand up okay thank\n11:33\nyou yes Simon what do you got what I understand is that\n11:39\num that the that some of the funds would go\n11:45\nrather to the spos right right\n11:52\nyeah you mean not the treasury funds are going to the sbos the uh cut so the 10%\n12:00\nthat right would go to the treasury would then go to the SOS and also sure\n12:05\nto ourself if we are staking to the spos right but chimber laabs has its own\n12:12\nStak pool as well no right right I mean I still agree that with\n12:20\nwith the point I think chimber labs mix more through uh Grant\n12:26\nbut I mean what do I know but that's my strong suspicion yeah I mean if you go\n12:32\nto the projects page then only income is from Catalyst and all the proposals uh\n12:38\nor projects are funded because of catalyst\n12:44\nright yeah that is true and I think that that's a that's an important point is\n12:50\nthat gimal laabs is is funded indeed uh from this you know tax or the\n12:59\nthe way I've always explained is it's the physics of the blockchain that whenever we make a\n13:05\ntransaction portion of that uh whenever there's any activity portion of that goes into this Treasury and a portion of\n13:11\nthat treasury goes to Catalyst and a portion of that Catalyst funds goes to\n13:17\ngimal apps and is uh is paying me and and Harsha right now right now um which\n13:24\nis great which is great um some of the pros and cons\n13:30\nuh so if you have access and let me share\n13:36\nthis um link if you have access you can put a comment into this\n13:45\num into this uh message uh into this notion page\n13:52\nwe'll put that out there [Music]\n14:00\nokay so I think Simon is your hands still up do you have more comments or\n14:07\nokay so I want to do this as an S3 thing we have only only have about five more\n14:14\nminutes so I want to just get uh a temperature check and a quick clarifying\n14:22\nround uh do you feel like so here's the question as we do a around um do you\n14:28\nfeel like like we like you need more information or do you have like an\n14:33\nopinion I don't want you to say your opinion uh because this isn't because we don't have enough time to sort of at\n14:39\nthis moment uh uh to discuss opinions but I just want to get your sense of\n14:44\nlike oh yeah this is important I want to talk more about it or or or not um so we'll have a quick round um\n14:53\nI oh I feel\n14:59\nnow the question is kind of hard for me I feel I feel like I have enough\n15:04\ninformation to make an informed consent um like I don't I don't need to\n15:10\nask any more clarifying questions um James how how about you do you feel you\n15:16\nknow do you have like any kind of reaction or you feel like you have enough information I have enough\n15:24\ninformation okay cool Adrian um I'm uh\n15:30\nAdrian and then Andrew yeah yes I have enough information yeah okay perfect\n15:36\nperfect Andrew and then\n15:43\nEmanuel uh Andrew do you feel like you've got you know like you have a strong opinion or\n15:49\ndo you feel like you want you have enough information or or if there's something that uh you you want to bring\n15:54\nup Andrew okay we're going to move on to Manuel and then\n16:05\nARA okay Emanuel came off mute but I can't hear you you can put it\n16:12\nin the chat also and that might help us if you right now oh yeah we got you\n16:17\nbuddy okay yeah sorry uh so what I was saying is whatever that uh would be\n16:24\nhelpful to gimal Labs uh indirectly uh it should be considered that I think uh\n16:29\nScott mentioned um on uh the rational sorry I don't know um on what he thinks\n16:37\nis going to be helpful to gims in um um this um when um there's a decision\n16:45\non um the decrease of Treasury tax uh which is indirectly helping gimal laabs\n16:52\nin you know in the funding process so yes I think we should move on with that\n16:59\nokay okay yeah um paraa and then\n17:05\nMartin uh I I feel like I have enough information not that I can make a Deion\n17:11\nbut I think I have enough information and also I understand that gimal ABS currently depends on Catalyst but I\n17:18\npersonally I don't want the status quo to continue uh I really hope like we can be self- sustainable and not depend on\n17:25\nexternal organizations yeah a good point that's a good point um Martin and then\n17:32\nMonique I'm uh listening with a half ear so okay all right listening nice uh\n17:40\nMo'Nique and then Nelson so I honestly I'm catching up to\n17:46\nspeed a little bit I I I think I understand what's happening here and our\n17:51\nparticular position being funded by cadas but um I think that so the overall\n17:57\nlike purpose or or goal of of of this proposal um it was it's to increase hold\n18:06\non this is uh is to it's justified by uh increased staking uh returns and um\n18:14\npromoting decentralization I and I think that's like that's supposed to be the the\n18:20\nbenefit correct am I getting that right okay yeah okay yeah okay so I I I I\n18:26\nunderstand and um I have enough information I am perfect yeah perfect\n18:32\nthank you um Nelson and then\n18:37\nScott um yeah I also have enough information to understand proposal um\n18:43\nyeah and I have an opinion about it okay okay cool cool um let's go to Scott\n18:51\nScott I definitely know just to hear your voice though buddy yeah I've got enough information I just I do want to\n18:57\nlet everybody know that I'm not trying to sway a decision either of the way for gimal abbs um and I don't know if my\n19:03\napproach to this proposal was correct because I've never written a proposal for gimbal ABS so um anyway that's that\n19:09\nbut yeah I have enough information thank you excellent yeah and I do want to I do want to highlight that uh as I see James\n19:16\nwith the hand clapping this um you know we're not you know the consent a consent\n19:22\nprocess like this is making like a a civil container um I do want to recognize that Scott took the initiative\n19:29\nto sort of take on this with some with some you know uh uh um it was difficult\n19:36\nhe expressed how difficult it was because there's sort of conflict of interest and he's very uh fastidious or\n19:43\nvery uh like he he takes it very seriously this this sort of conflict of\n19:49\ninterest and and trying to be a representative uh and he does this more just to get the ball rolling and\n19:57\nlikewise I want to um acknowledge Adrien who was able to give like a good\n20:02\nCounterpoint like we have this phrase about getting to the no and that a no or\n20:08\nan objection is really a gift because that gives us the the space to sort of work these things out um so we're not\n20:15\ntrying to say this is right or this is wrong we're just trying to go through a process to sort of ascertain the thing\n20:21\nokay okay um uh Sebastian and then\n20:27\nSimon yeah I having information perfect so you got it the\n20:32\nbest um\n20:40\nSimon got oh yeah that's right he's already done um okay so I know that I\n20:46\nknow that Scott has to like he has to like be closing the door at uh 11 of his\n20:51\nhouse so um God do um I guess we can asked I one\n21:01\none of the unfortunate things about this is that the the window to vote is uh is\n21:06\ncoming up uh quickly um we I do W to I I do want to even\n21:16\nthough you may not be able to stay um I do want to get Adrian and\n21:25\nNelson um and Adrian you've kind of given your sort of your your uh uh your\n21:30\nobjection meaning and I think it was clearly stated that uh that look gimbal\n21:35\nLabs depends on catalist funds funds from that that tax uh is from there so\n21:42\nuh is that sum up the the argument that's one of\n21:49\nmys uh I would have some more but I don't think we have time for that yeah I\n21:55\nknow it's so it's so bad to uh so so Scott before you have to leave and I I\n22:00\njust want to do you want to um Le let's let's get your voice in here uh before\n22:06\nyou have to go on which\n22:13\nside um let's uh yeah what do you think about that and I know that this you know\n22:20\nbecause you know you don't you have a strong opinion for yourself but as gimble Labs uh you know I think it's\n22:26\nreasonable that that that tax comes from do you have anything that that sort of\n22:32\nhelps us understand better that are we seeing that clearly uh that you know that we're really funded by this tax and\n22:38\nthat you know that a vote on no to to keep the tax as it is is is probably\n22:43\nbest for for gimal labs yeah on that I don't know if it's best like I I don't know gimal Labs um\n22:52\nthey're budget where their funds come from or the economy of the uh Stak pool that is operated so\n22:59\nuh but if if indeed if indeed the the treasury is paying for the uh proposals\n23:04\nthat are funded um that I can see the impact on that if they were to decrease\n23:09\nthat um but gimal ABS also isn't the only entity or organization that is also\n23:15\nreceiving funding from the treasury so by and I'm playing Devil's Advocate so\n23:20\nby PL by by voting no because gimal lab's funding gets there is from there\n23:27\nyou're also pretty much giving a pass to every other project that's getting funding whether or not they're efficient\n23:33\nuseful or of the same so\n23:38\nand I as far as gimal abbs goes like I said I I will abstain anyway since I'm a d and I've already placed my vote and\n23:45\njust trying to play Devil's Advocate with the uh justification just mention yep all right and and Sebastian has his\n23:54\nhad his hand up I missed it twice sorry about that Sebastian no no no I prefer to to to\n24:00\nstate something about this this thing of\n24:06\ngimbals has catalyst is the only option to F gimal UPS in when I present my\n24:13\nproposal because I want I have a proposal to present today if we have the\n24:19\ntime but in general term in general terms I I think um it's a fact today but\n24:25\nuh for in that sense we have to move the organization or the this this exercise\n24:33\nto to another scenarios okay yeah thanks yeah I I definitely I definitely\n24:41\nagree um uh that yeah and then uh Simon I see that your hands up yeah I think\n24:49\nthere's\n24:54\num oh you you muted uh sorry yeah I just sat down the\n25:00\ncomputer and unmuted myself on the computer so I heard myself twice um yeah so I just wanted to make one more point\n25:06\nabout it which is I think it's an unfortunate timing to have it right now because everything with the budget is\n25:12\ncoming up I think it would have been better to have raised the question after the budget has gone through or yeah\n25:20\nmaybe before all the the budget craziness yeah I I think I I couldn't\n25:27\nvote any other way other than than no in this case but I can see like maybe in\n25:33\nthe future if it happen if it comes up again I could see myself vote Yes\n25:39\nactually interesting yeah yeah that is interesting and I'm gonna say goodbye to Scott and thank you so much for bringing\n25:46\nthis up and really taking the lead with h the the D role here Scott um it's really really been\n25:52\nincredible um okay uh so Andrew yeah Andrew we haven't heard from you\n25:59\nyou yeah sorry about that I think it was going to be my turn the internet dropped out I was really frustrating um so if\n26:07\nwe're still talking about this vote I'm inclined to go no um my reason is is uh\n26:14\non the face of it that sounds good to be as a Staker that you may get some extra rewards but there's a couple of things\n26:21\nuh I think James last week mentioned made a very good point about it's pretty disingenuous to label it as a t\n26:29\nbecause yeah the money stays in the ecosystem when when that money um gets\n26:35\npaid out to spos we don't know where that goes where that a goes that's fair enough that's\n26:40\nyou know their reward keep propping up the ecosystem but the the AER from the\n26:48\nto stays in the treasury which we as a part of cardano get to choose where\n26:55\nit goes and that's kind of what a lot of this governance is going to be about so to call it attacked I think is is a bit wrong um and then the other thing I look\n27:01\nat is the proponents of this um proposal in the first place seem to be mostly\n27:07\nmultipool operators um I'm going to be careful with my words now I don't want to offend anyone but\n27:15\nuh multipool operators\n27:22\nwell I'm not as keen on the concept of it so um yeah as much as on face it it\n27:28\nwould seem good for me as a Staker to to to vote Yes I think it's all a bit disingenuous so I say no yeah okay um I\n27:40\nNelson Nelson I know that you had something and and we'll extend just a little bit but I definitely want to come\n27:45\nup and we we can make a make a motion or sort of propose and just say hey a yes\n27:51\nor a no and we can do it uh uh we can do it that way I think I feel like that\n27:58\nmight be okay at this at this point but I'll hear from Nels um yeah without talking about my\n28:05\nopinion I think this vote is not going through right because we're not meeting\n28:12\nthe Constitutional thresold for the uh yeah for the Constitutional committee so\n28:19\nI I'm not sure if we are spending good time here or not because I yeah uh we\n28:25\nneed um 67% thre for the vote to go through and three of\n28:32\nthem voted no and one of them voted abstain so I don't think this going\n28:37\nthrough yeah yes uh\n28:43\nSimon and thanks thanks Nelson that is a good point yeah I wanted to just make one\n28:49\nmore comment about the disingenuous thing because I agree totally agree with that when I read that I thought this was\n28:56\nnot not framed well and I think this goes also more importantly I think this goes\n29:02\nto towards the culture that we want to have do we want to have like a political class that frames things like that or do\n29:10\nwe want to have um like a genuine uh fact based discussion right on with the\n29:18\nterms that are that are actually accurate and that we that we should use\n29:24\nhere and TX is not the the name or the the the framing and the the wding that\n29:30\ncomes to mind when I when I think about this yeah I think that's uh I'm glad\n29:36\nthat you mentioned that I'm glad that this is something because when I read this I'm like wait a minute this is just this is um uh a campaign speeches and\n29:46\nand we need to really see we need to have better you know like and is that a\n29:51\nmy my question was is that something that we can do as a community to sort of\n29:56\ncall it out and then re reframe it to where we can really get a sense of what exactly it is\n30:04\num James I see your hands up and and to that point like and picking up from Nelson's question is this worth the time\n30:12\nthis may be an early example of a proposal that we are best\n30:18\nignoring right like voting no is to take it seriously in a certain way not voting\n30:25\nat all is a way of prag a atically recognizing that the threshold is not\n30:30\nbeing met anyway and it's a way of publicly declaring that this is a silly\n30:37\nproposal framed in a particular terms that really don't\n30:43\napply um and so yeah I you know I think it's good to have an active goal of being sure to vote on everything while\n30:51\nalso recognizing that maybe not voting will sometimes be an action in itself\n31:00\nyes so so we've got options yes no abstain and ignore ignore ignore seems\n31:08\ncoming to the surface as a possibility right here right right I in the go ahead\n31:18\njust um what what what happens if\n31:26\num if everyone one ignores it but like a few people is there a threshold\n31:33\nthat needs to be met well you can see right here the the\n31:38\nconstitutionality threshold already won't to be met yeah whether we agree with that or\n31:45\nnot this is a system that works in a certain way and the way the system has\n31:50\nalready resolved this question is that three of seven on the Constitutional\n31:57\ncommittee have already registered a motion that this is\n32:03\nunconstitutional right and so therefore just as pragmatic rational actors in\n32:09\nthis ecosystem how much time do we want to give to this otherwise ridiculous\n32:14\nproposal and we all right all right right and we can go we can be we can\n32:20\nmake a public statement we can post this video wherever we want to right so\n32:26\nthat's an option right and so it's not always going to be passive to not vote it's possible to not vote and say look\n32:34\nwe gave this the time it's worth it's really not worth the time right now I agree with Simon that there's a point in\n32:40\nthe future where a yes vote might make a ton of sense um but right now it's it's\n32:46\na distraction that pulls in a political discourse that only exists in some but\n32:52\nnot all countries and and some people who live in one of those countries countes brought their problems to the\n32:59\ntable and framed it this way right like how much so how much time do we want to give those guys how much do we want to\n33:05\nfacilitate that kind of discourse and I'm glad people already named that here right we don't we can choose as a norm\n33:12\nnot to engage in that way yeah yeah right I was asking more from a d\n33:19\nperspective is there you can also you can see that current result as well and\n33:26\nso what's what's the number of no votes from DS already um yeah no I'm asking is there a\n33:32\nthreshold like if there's only I don't know 5% voting yes and everyone else abstains is gonna go through Yeah well\n33:40\nyeah and and if you saw that happening you would spring into action and you would register a vote but that's not the\n33:47\ncase right now yeah right right okay so with that in mind I think we're ready to\n33:54\nbecause uh you're right and we do have very important business so I and\n34:01\nHarsha what do you think um I think I'm I'm ready to uh uh just to to take a\n34:08\nround and and um propose ignore from the from the gimal grabs gimal Labs\n34:16\nD I'm cool with that yeah okay so this will have a uh let's\n34:25\nhave like a a voting round uh uh do you have an objection to um\n34:32\nignore and I'll go down the line um I I have no objection to uh and uh to to\n34:39\nignore James and then Adrien no\n34:45\nobjections uh Adrian No Object objections let's save the transaction\n34:51\nfee beautiful uh Andrew and then Emanuel yeah no OB from\n34:58\nme Emanuel then Hara yeah I have no\n35:05\nobjection yeah same no objection Martin then\n35:12\nmix he's just Martin just might be listening in I uh I agree yeah mix and mo hey guys\n35:23\nuh yeah I have no objection and I guess uh it would be a good opportunity for\n35:29\nthem to do better yeah yeah yeah yeah for those reasons that we mentioned earlier I definitely I definitely think\n35:35\nokay uh Monique and then Nelson no objection okay perfect thank\n35:41\nyou Nelson then Sebastian yeah I have no objection nice\n35:46\nnice Sebastian then Simon no\n35:54\nobjection S no look at that now we celebrate thank you thank you\n36:00\nvery much for working through that I feel like I feel like that was the process working I'm going to I'm I'm\n36:06\ntapping the uh the celebrate button um thank you so\n36:11\nmuch all right so you know I I think I think\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Which Spaces\n36:18\nthat's beautiful because there's other projects to be done here let's get into which spaces and you know I'd invite you\n36:26\nto sort of move around you know uh shift gears over into um this uh this other uh\n36:35\nCommunity uh uh proposal James is the owner and Source um this as you know is\n36:42\nthe catalyst is our Catalyst funding we have these um this is an\n36:50\ninflow of uh uh of uh of\n36:55\nmonies and that doesn't have our flow in here well the Catalyst fun 13 proposal\n37:01\nwould provide the inflow and this will back outflow from it okay um James do\n37:09\nyou want to uhh take the helm and uh guide us through this I can uh I I'm sharing the screen so I can point us in\n37:15\nthe right direction yeah thanks and so this proposal is pretty well along um we I think we talked about kind\n37:24\nof the driver and and those details and people have a chance to look at it and I'll drop it in the chat right now just\n37:29\nin case people need to read through here is the public\n37:39\nlink um but yeah so the goal here is to um keep public spaces at gimal Labs\n37:48\ngoing um the sort of spaces for example that are gutted when people in power\n37:54\ndecide to give everybody else a tax break and uh privatize public services\n38:00\nbut we'll we'll leave that aside for now um we are in the business of keeping\n38:05\npublic spaces open that's what we do at gimal laabs and what we want to do is\n38:11\nalso be supporting facilitators to get better and better at their craft and the\n38:17\nway we do that is by making sure that we're using some of our budget to fund\n38:22\npeople for facilitating meetings and we have the beginnings of a of a network of people who are\n38:29\npracticing this so for example Harsha and Newman have taken on facilitation of\n38:35\nthis space a few times this year and when when I have the privilege of\n38:41\nhanding it off to them I get to be a participant again which is a role I\n38:46\nreally enjoy playing um and I get to learn a lot um because being a\n38:52\nfacilitator you see everything through a different lens you're on a different Newman you can probably relate to this from today you're on a different kind of\n38:58\nalert that prevents you from thinking through all the ideas clearly because you are serving the rest of the\n39:03\ncommunity and that's a really big deal and so to share this across our growing\n39:10\necosystem and to make sure we're placing value in it that's what this proposal does right it takes the spaces we that\n39:18\nhave emerged at gimal Labs that have evolved to their current state which you can see down below number seven there's\n39:25\na table that name the spaces that we keep going over a closed time frame this\n39:33\nproposal is only about the first half of 2025 running spaces through May and then\n39:43\nactually another thing this proposal kind of um gives us the option to do is\n39:49\nto take some time off after may I do think that some seasons of not having\n39:56\nmeetings but doing maybe deep work or hackathons together is something I would really like to explore maybe in June and\n40:04\nso that's why I I I'm not making any proposal about that formally right now\n40:10\num but at least this proposal ends in May so that we can set the stage to have\n40:15\nsome options for using time differently maybe during some months or seasons of the year um so what you can see in that\n40:22\ntable right we're going to keep running aen live coding on Tuesdays this proposal require re Ires no funding for\n40:28\nthat because that's a separately funded project cardano all things go we just\n40:34\nstarted mix uh facilitated the third session of that yesterday and it's\n40:40\nreally starting to have a flow and a voice I think that that that session got really good reviews from people as we\n40:47\nwere leaving there's this Open Spaces session um speaks for itself this is\n40:55\nwhat we do um and then following this session uh the we just added a gimal ABS\n41:01\nTech standup which kind of toes the line between what what later sessions of\n41:08\nplutus pbl live coding have done in the past right giving anybody a chance to show up bring questions or demos work on\n41:15\nstuff together um and it's a step towards um moving us into a season at\n41:23\ngimal ABS where we are building stuff more often and this is already happening so the esteria work is really running on\n41:31\nits own driven by the people working on that project the plutus pbl maintainers\n41:38\nwork has really stood for itself and as as this continues and\n41:44\nlater if we have time I have a request for proposals for a technical project\n41:49\nthat I would like to just bring to the group and and see if anybody wants to pick it up but as this continues to\n41:56\nhappen and we do have these you know in S3 we would call them circles right\n42:01\nself-organizing circles um something like a weekly standup where people can get together\n42:07\nshow off and ask each other questions I think becomes a really engaging thing and that's why we're trying that\n42:12\nexperiment so with this calendar right here down below you can see an estimate\n42:17\nof how many sessions would run Open Spaces I'd like to make this retroactive to\n42:23\nJanuary um and so this would be funding for January through May total of 18 sessions it says about 18 just because\n42:31\nit might be if if we cancel a few more of them for any number of reasons that would be like the most um all things go\n42:37\nwould max out at 11 sessions Tech standup would max out at 11 sessions so you can see we have about 40 sessions at\n42:46\na proposed rate of 200 Ada for facilitating each one and that's why\n42:52\nthis proposal is asking for 8,000 Ada from the gimal ABS treasury to facilitate these sessions plus a\n43:00\nthousand for just Catalyst reporting itself which is critical this helps people know what we've been doing and\n43:06\nand invites other people into the work a thousand I think it is good to put this\n43:12\naside just for continued R&D about how we report on these things right there's\n43:17\nthe Catalyst reporting that we have to do but how about a th Ada for just\n43:24\nexperimenting with the ways we tell the stories about these spaces to whatever\n43:31\nstakeholders we don't have to decide exactly how to use it but I think this is really good for anybody who wants to\n43:37\npick up kind of that storytelling piece um and then keeping the calendar up to date I can continue to take care of that\n43:44\njust as part of this and then when I brought this proposal last week it did\n43:49\nopen a really good conversation about marketing but just to keep things easy to manage from a proposal perspective I\n43:56\nse seated those notes into a new Doc so we don't have to make marketing the\n44:01\nscope of this proposal just to keep facilitation going uh but I think we\n44:07\nshould flesh out a marketing plan for anybody who's interested in it so those\n44:12\nare the most important updates I just copied the same table if if you're not familiar with linked or synced blocks in\n44:20\nnotion this is a really helpful way you can edit in one place um and it stays the same in the other so this is just a\n44:26\ncop um of the same table that's above so you can read it again when it comes to responsibilities right we just want to\n44:32\nhave facilitators for all of these sessions I think it's okay if there aren't names on them yet like so Tech\n44:39\nstandup you can see in April and May there's nobody assigned to that yet um\n44:45\nthe reason I'm fine keeping it blank is I'm happy to do it but I won't fill in\n44:50\nmy name until giving somebody else the chance to take it on um and Newman Hara\n44:56\nif you guys become the default for Open Spaces but other people have the option\n45:01\nof jumping in how would you feel about that I wouldn't mind that necessarily um\n45:08\nwe definitely are going to do uh next week and uh the week after that will be\n45:14\nthe uh but yeah we wouldn't I don't yeah we'll have to talk it with with over with ARA but yeah that could that could\n45:20\nwork and I like that having um we could say this is the default host um because\n45:27\none of the nice things about a giant Community is that you know things happen and and it's good to have people to fill\n45:32\nin and those Fillin spots can lead into the more default post so\n45:38\nyeah cool thank you yeah that's exactly how I'm thinking of it and it it echoes to what Scott said about writing the\n45:46\nprevious proposal we were talking about the DP vote like somebody has to do that first step right but but he made it\n45:53\nclear he didn't want to be seen as wanting to express a strong opinion he was trying to get a conversation started\n46:00\nand in a similar way a default host is there as a service not because they're\n46:06\ntrying to grab a rooll and keep it from anybody else but because it's good to know like okay if nobody else steps up\n46:12\nhere's who's going to do this but we can keep practicing offering the option to\n46:18\nother people and and eventually people do step up yeah y I think that that's and that that terminology I think is\n46:24\nreally great so responsibilities that's why these responsibilities aren't fully fleshed\n46:31\nout but I hope that makes sense to folks that they they are fleshed out but they're left open to keep that door open\n46:39\num and yeah potential risks I think it's worth it just to name right we're uncertain about the impact of these\n46:46\nspaces and some of it is you know some of it you could compare to planting a tree and and you're not going to see its\n46:51\nfruit for a long time obviously that's that's a nice story we can tell ourselves if we're not sure about our\n46:57\nimpact um but we we we maybe want to start looking for ways to decide whether\n47:04\nthese spaces are are delivering value and that's a really hard thing to do um and\n47:12\nso that's why it's good just to list some risks and mitigations just to say look we have questions we're we're we\n47:17\ndon't know the long-term import of this um but at least by reminding each other\n47:24\nof that we can stay open and and dedicated to like asking those questions so yeah I think that's I think\n47:31\nthis is pretty complete um and yeah I can pass it off to Newman to facilitate the process yeah so now the first thing\n47:39\nand if you recall our process the first round that we do is to and we can\n47:45\npopcorn style this it's like do you have questions that clarify not an opinion\n47:51\nwhether this should be funded or not necessarily at this stage but just uh there's something that uh we call it\n47:57\nclarifying questions and it's if you have in you have an informational\n48:03\nrequest of James the owner or the community at large uh harsh do that does\n48:10\nthat match where we're at in the process now sounds good yes yes\n48:16\nokay so and we'll do this popcorn style so if you have uh a clarifying question\n48:22\nuh just uh you can just jump off mute and and uh and speak or put it in the\n48:28\nchat arsha will mind the\n48:33\nchat okay so people feel we've done this we\n48:39\ndid we've done this process once before so we we we did this or they fund\n48:46\n12 um uh uh project Catalyst uh uh sustain\n48:53\nand maintain gimbal Labs proposal so it's should be pretty familiar\n48:58\neverybody's being quiet I'm feeling like it's pretty\n49:04\nestablished I do have I have a question and that is\n49:11\nprerequisites so is this a prerequisite for the\n49:17\nfacilitator James yes I forgot that I even added that here so yeah the idea\n49:22\nhere is um we are in we're moving all of these projects one by one into\n49:30\nandamio and so we could play with this concept like what what would somebody\n49:36\nhave had to do first before they could join as a facilitator for one of these\n49:44\nspaces right um and I don't think we have to fully answer that question now\n49:50\num it'll be an exciting moment if somebody we've never met before shows up\n49:56\nand says hey can I facilitate next week um I think we can save that question for\n50:01\nwhen it happens right for now anybody who's expressed interest in\n50:07\nfacilitation is at least known to others because they've showed up for a certain number of meetings so far um and so I\n50:13\nthink we can leave it like that and then on the technical side we've talked about this in the dev space the last few weeks\n50:19\nand this will be a continued thing um where we talk about like what are the prcts to joining any project that's\n50:27\napproved here but I don't think it has to be the scope of this proposal right right um yeah the for\n50:35\ninstance you wouldn't want somebody that doesn't have uh Tech and development\n50:40\nexperience you know hosting the the the tech standup meaning that the real value\n50:46\nin that is having an experienced person there to sort of guide uh I always like to think of them as uh computer lab\n50:54\nattendance like those guys knew so much stuff and if you just be friends with them order a pizza you're in you're\n51:03\nin uh you know one of the things about this facilitation that we're doing is uh\n51:08\nthe facilitators collective uh actually has a course and it's something that I've completed um okay any other\n51:17\nquestions um I can show\n51:23\nthe oh wait oh it's up at the top there is a budget workshop and so one of the\n51:28\nthings about when you read these you know you can really you can really go\n51:33\ndown and ask like go to the requirements and what it's asking um and and the\n51:40\nbudget is a big one um so in that vein I created this\n51:45\nspreadsheet and it is [Music]\n51:52\nhere and is the total budget well anyway this you know we can but so\n52:01\nwe're going to we're offloading the marketing and so this gets down to\n52:08\nzero um and so we're gonna this is a $10,000 um a 10,000 Ada um\n52:16\nrequest right okay\n52:22\nokay yeah I feel uh let's H let's Okay Bon\n52:31\nyeah respect to the pr Rex I think we can we can lower the the\n52:38\nbarrier asking for H taking the specific model the facilit the new facilitator\n52:44\nwant to want to facilitate right because it's really complicated to to push the\n52:51\npeople to take the whole L to gain that spot facility in\n52:57\nthings um we can okay maybe you want to I don't know you but the thing is I\n53:04\ndon't know you but you can you can participate so at least take the model that you want to\n53:10\nfacilitate and it's let's see from that right\n53:16\nright yeah yeah\n53:23\nexcellent paraa I think that our next our next process is are we to\n53:33\nOB objections and concerns yeah oh yeah uh does anyone have um concerns or\n53:42\nwant to frame the discussion here uh James is the owner and I'll and\n53:50\nI'll go down the line here Adrian and Andrew any\n53:57\nuh like a concern it's like anything that pops up sounds good\n54:03\nto me okay excellent thank you Andrew anything that's popping popping up to you that you want to\n54:09\nverbalize uh no no um I think this is a fair proposal and uh yeah shout out to\n54:16\neveryone who contributes around here and um you get uh yeah it's great place to\n54:22\nbe around nice um Emanual and then\n54:28\nHara concerns and objections no I have no objection to\n54:36\nthis uh because I was about to ask if this is the first time this is coming up\n54:42\nuh and uh I think said it was I think I\n54:47\nthink he said it was done in the last uh yeah it was done in the last F round so\n54:53\nyes uh so this is the way to about it yes no objection perfect perfect um harsh and\n55:02\nthen manual yeah uh no objections yeah uh Martin and then next thanks thanks uh\n55:10\nMara uh no objections cool mix and then Monique yep\n55:16\nno objection either okay cool Monique no\n55:22\nobjections thanks Nelson and then Sebastian no\n55:31\nOB no objections okay Simon so Simon asked\n55:37\nthat he had stepped away so this basically is our object objection round and it and it's where you know if you\n55:44\nhave any strong opinion um about whether we ex we adopt this proposal um uh this\n55:51\nis where you would would voice it it can also be a concern it's just like oh well maybe the this part needs to be uh\n56:00\nchanged yeah it's okay I don't I don't want to waste anyone's time on this we\n56:05\ngot all right all right I love it um yeah I think that we can um adopt this\n56:14\nproposal and I uh this proposal is adopted no objections all around hey\n56:20\ncelebration time I definitely want to get a screen something that celebrates\n56:26\nhere you know what I mean the T icon can only take you so far it's really it's it it\n56:32\nused to be so cool you know but now um and we can um oh oh wait a minute wait a\n56:39\nminute this is a little more so where we\n56:45\ngo here and we move this is it we move it right now\n56:53\nthis is satisfying wa wait don't we oh no we can do it here status\n57:00\nthis one two in progress and it goes down\n57:11\nhere right this one okay progress\n57:18\nhooray okay now so we're shifting gears again um oh we're going to move this\n57:26\nwant to backlog this one goes backlog done I I\n57:31\nthought it was it was we yeah we go to done yeah we go to\n57:37\ndone okay hooray all right that's our celebrate thing can we drag it you can\nA quick check, Proposal: Gimbalabs Marketing Plan.\n57:44\ncan we go like this you can okay I don't want to try it live on TV I think the uh the destination has to be open but yeah\n57:50\nit should work oh okay cool um now this one draft of the gimbal Labs marketing\n57:58\nplan now this one I don't think there's been progress on this one since last week I didn't\n58:04\nhave time to Fork it until today um okay but yeah we can Seb do you want to pick\n58:10\nup the marketing one now or should we save that one in the planning or\n58:18\nbacklog yeah I think I I think this guy and Shaggy Shaggy one wants to be in the\n58:27\nThe Proposal that I don't know we can we can ping him with a link to this yeah\n58:34\nyeah okay is he in\n58:40\nthe is he is oh not yet not yet he's not in\n58:47\nokay um but just taking a brief look at this one uh this one is the gimbal ABS marketing\n58:55\nplan and remember we took out some budget from the witch spaces into the marketing which I think makes a lot of\n59:00\nsense um so uh there is a lot that goes into marketing and I know Simon you has\n59:07\nhand up go ahead Simon yeah so I've been thinking about\n59:13\nuh about working on this for chimber labs with a friend of\n59:18\nmine um yeah but I'm not best friends with shagy so\n59:25\nI'm not sure if that is a good option anymore to be honest you don't\n59:31\nnecessarily only have to work with best friends you can work with everyone example I was gonna give I was\n59:38\ngonna tell har a bad joke I always joke around with har but do you have a a is there you guys are do well\n59:48\nyeah I I think yeah I I tried not not to get\n59:53\ninvolved with him I I think yeah I've been working with him on the uh\n59:58\nmarketing working group in intersect and it didn't it only hurt me I don't want\n1:00:04\nto be involved with him anymore yeah yeah however that's all I'm gonna say in this case I think we\n1:00:11\ncan you can prepare a proposal in the same way in the same area right in the same with the same topic and as\n1:00:18\nCommunity you can decide okay this this proposal has more sense to it's more aligned with the primary R of gimbal\n1:00:25\nabsur or shag's proposal or something like that this is a good this I think this is a good situation because we have\n1:00:32\nseveral people interested on on participating the marketing site but\n1:00:38\nwith a different different approach right that's valid so I invite you to to\n1:00:44\ntake the present a proposal so if if I were to do that I would need some um\n1:00:50\ninformation about the goals and the general strategy of chimol labs where\n1:00:55\ncan of I can I can help you I can have you har I don't know you can also I can\n1:01:00\nmake some notes right we can open a document a public document in in Ocean\n1:01:06\nand start adding adding some points there for everybody that wants to to be\n1:01:12\na proposal around marketing all right okay so I get I get in contact with you Sebastian and um you can refer me to the\n1:01:19\nnecessary information yeah I will open the I will open the document and I ping\n1:01:26\nyou when when this is ready and also I will ping to to\n1:01:32\nshaggi to when the document is ready right and everyone of you can can offer\n1:01:38\nthe do this their thing I don't know if if any of you guys\n1:01:44\nhave of girls have some some objection in the approach I think it's the most\n1:01:50\nmost the most fair for everybody yeah and now so this is draft\n1:01:56\nlike a marketing plan which I know that Simon has like a good amount of experience on based on his work with\n1:02:02\nintersect and some other things um but it also is fulfilling the responsibility\n1:02:08\nfor things that we've got written down here uh bringing people to the session\n1:02:13\num that that the that there's life and action on the social networks that we\n1:02:19\nhave a consistent open and live gimbal lab spaces um establishing workflows\n1:02:26\nlike a set of tasks and and times to do things as far as our promotion uh\n1:02:31\nannouncements in web hooks like calendaring um you know we talked about\n1:02:38\nsort of the automated tools um Twitter spaces uh just representing uh gimbal\n1:02:44\nlabs in the in the market uh uh reporting and tracking metrics so what I\n1:02:50\nsee is that there's actually a big ecosystem uh you know a department so uh\n1:02:56\nand it's in a decentralized way meaning that you know if you were to you know\n1:03:01\nthere may be something that you can do even you don't have to work really uh so closely with others um for instance this\n1:03:09\nMedia Kit maintenance the that feels like it's a a periodic thing uh as\n1:03:16\nopposed to um like a operational uh weekly maintenance of\n1:03:22\nmaking announcements which is basically what Sebastian does now um but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I I\n1:03:29\ndefinitely think there's a place for uh opport there are opportunities here\n1:03:37\num so Sebastian or Simon is your hands still up\n1:03:45\nor yeah uh what are the next actions here you know this it feels like we need\n1:03:52\nmore um more work to make it more\n1:03:57\ndefined is that is that a in fact in fact I don't have to we\n1:04:04\ndon't have to open a new document we can we can use this to add some notes at the\n1:04:09\nend of the at the end of the of the do okay\n1:04:15\nyeah yeah so we'll keep this one we'll keep this one in uh\n1:04:22\nconsent and uh uh could we in the 20 10 10 to 15 minutes we've got\n1:04:30\nleft uh which of these would be good to attack\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Gimbalabs Incubator and Accelerator. Phase 1: Front End Support.\n1:04:36\nnext i' like to share something about the galap in Creator that's a proposal\n1:04:42\nthat I want to to present today excellent that is that is yeah go\n1:04:48\nahead yeah let's do it okay this proposal is aligned with um what we are\n1:04:54\ndiscussing just a few moments about the the only\n1:05:00\nthe finance the funding sources of gimbals this is a a think an idea that I\n1:05:05\nhave had and I I I'm sure that I I was not the only one trying to\n1:05:14\nto to identify some another sources funding sources for for game Bops right\n1:05:22\nand this is this proposal is based on conversations that I I had the\n1:05:28\nopportunity to to have with ex students and ex dep students in in that took some\n1:05:38\nuh some some classes and lessons in the in\n1:05:43\nthe spaces in the gal spaces and their level of satisfaction H\n1:05:50\nER takes them to think that H seriously on make some donations to to galops in\n1:05:59\nexchange of the the pro the the activities educational activities we make here so and today we have we are in\n1:06:07\nthis ecosystem where the incubation and acceleration is taking a really good a really good first\n1:06:14\nstage and this is I think I think this is This falls into the the expertise of\n1:06:22\ngimbal UPS as Community organization so the thing is um building\n1:06:30\nincubator is a really big exercise it's a complex cace like that and in in that\n1:06:37\nsense we can H start for step by step um\n1:06:43\nidentifying um urgent Necessities in the ecosystem in the developer ecosystem and\n1:06:49\nstart to support some in in some way those kind of Necessities one of the the\n1:06:55\nthe most clearness needs in the uh needs\n1:07:00\nis the the frontend front end development the the the projects and startups in the ecosystem needs urgently\n1:07:08\nsome kind of support in the front side right and they have the budget they have the budget to to to support\n1:07:14\nto to to fund those kind of some kind of\n1:07:20\num um assistance and support in that way right but we have zero\n1:07:26\nH dep force in in in that front in that layer of the developer stack so my idea\n1:07:34\nwith this proposal is to um um start building this idea of uh\n1:07:41\nmaking galops an incubator and an accelerator\n1:07:46\num based on and and the first step the first step is to build a a a collective\n1:07:53\nI I call that in this in this in this proposal Collective Collective of frontend developers not expert\n1:08:00\ndevelopers just gimbal apps members that have some kind of a experience some kind\n1:08:07\nof a domain in the area of front end development sufficient to support a a\n1:08:15\ncardano projects right and we know cardano projects are really not too complex projects in some\n1:08:23\nway they they are complex in the back end but in the front end they are as as\n1:08:28\nusual as the web to web to U projects um so my proposal is first\n1:08:35\nstart taking a steps into build that kind of circle that would be would be a new Circle um a basic Circle a basic\n1:08:43\nsale of developers from developers gimbal UPS members that can provide some\n1:08:49\nkind of support on that right I was thinking for example on Hara Hara has has has experience in ux development I\n1:08:58\nwas thinking on Newman that has some kind of I don't know I'm I'm just I can\n1:09:03\nhave a a rudimentary knowledge about you guys about your experience but I think you have some kind of exper expertise on\n1:09:12\nwhat is around uh front end development around ux experience and all that stuff\n1:09:19\nand I think we can use that and and and on only talking about just\n1:09:26\nboth of you guys but this this is an invitation to everybody that has some\n1:09:31\nkind of expertise in front of development basic no matter the the the\n1:09:39\nlevel yeah an invitation uh so that's the first start building the the circle the circle the\n1:09:47\nfront and circle with this approach of a supporting front end ER supporting\n1:09:53\ncardano projects in the area of incubation right of incub of supporting supporting projects uh in the\n1:10:02\ndetails of the proposal I invite you to read The Proposal in these details you can see uh first is the calling of the\n1:10:10\nof the members interested in in in in in be part of the of the circle the second\n1:10:15\nis around this the the these first um sessions that allow to start clarifying\n1:10:22\nprocedures and uh driver mapping in general general terms and the thing we\n1:10:27\nhave a a a rabit test rabit know I'm saying that really well I proposed\n1:10:35\nandamio because andamio first is a I I I gave there the the the reasons why\n1:10:42\nandamio is a good Prospect to serve to this ex this first exercise as the the a\n1:10:50\nproject test that can can resist all our experiments around frontend development\n1:10:58\nsupport um in among those merits that I think are valuable first is was is a\n1:11:05\ncompany funded by many of the instructors and and and and teachers\n1:11:11\nthat voluntarily have provide services to galops for for\n1:11:17\nyears and I think it's that makes them a\n1:11:22\napt to receive some kind of support and currently andamio is supporting\n1:11:28\ngimbals in in in provide in providing the courses the several courses that we\n1:11:35\nare today h delivering to the students and the cardano ecosystem in general in\n1:11:41\nour Open Spaces I have to say I have to say this H this prop this this whole\n1:11:48\nproposal is align with the primary driver of the of gimbal because the primary driver talks about\n1:11:56\nbuilding spaces building new spaces right and we have in in in today we have\n1:12:03\ninternal and and and and really well known spaces but internally at kind\n1:12:11\nof a in our wellknown wellknown uh radar\n1:12:18\nbut I think we must to start testing the boundaries of these limits of our usual\n1:12:25\nradar and start to think on expanding our expanding our\n1:12:30\nour our area of action in terms of spaces I think we can go and start to\n1:12:36\nbuilding spaces outside of the of our traditional uh our traditional ER\n1:12:45\ntraditional field right and start to build in a kind of pipeline between our\n1:12:50\ninternal and well-known spaces and these spaces that are FOC fused on incubating\n1:12:56\nand supporting supporting projects we can build there a kind of pipeline that can communicate both intentions right\n1:13:04\nimagine for example a proposer or a a entrepreneur a cardan entrepreneur on an\n1:13:10\nN entrepreneur or a Solan entrepreneur etc etc that wants to start building on\n1:13:16\ncardano right he can come here to envelops and start taking the the the\n1:13:21\nour our sessions and then they can go to our our circles in charge of supporting\n1:13:30\nprojects in a specific areas in this case front end but with time depending of how this experiment goes we can start\n1:13:37\nsupporting projects in other areas in backing areas specific more more more\n1:13:43\nmore in technically intense areas so yeah that's right um I think we we\n1:13:51\nhave okay that's that general idea if we go to the scroll down the impact the\n1:13:58\nimpact talks about that uh we can start we can K starting our efforts\n1:14:05\nthrough a a gimbal UPS incubator right and as a gimbals incubator we can have\n1:14:12\naccess not only to the Catalyst funds but also to intersect funds but also to\n1:14:17\ndonations from the developers direct donations to gimbal apps from H the\n1:14:23\ndevelopers that receive support we can charge to those to those projects if\n1:14:30\nthey have the they have the they have received for example a catalis proposal or they have they have a catalis\n1:14:36\nproposal or an intersect proposal in course we can we can there in the scenario we have several ways of getting\n1:14:43\nfunds and getting income and from years we have had that g in gimbal apps this\n1:14:49\nidea of gimbal up Solutions where we provide H the project services in in\n1:14:55\ndifferent areas right this front endend Collective can be the first of the whole\n1:15:01\narray of services we can provide to the to the people\n1:15:06\nyes uh so I read through the through the proposal and I'm curious as to what is\n1:15:13\nthe connection between anio and I think they're providing 10,000 data right did\n1:15:19\nI get that right yeah we have a proposed as uh as you know in in the section uh resources\n1:15:27\nresources I'm asking 10,000 Adas for funding for for funding two deps for h\n1:15:35\ntwo months the ration okay so this is a proposal that goes to uh anio right no\n1:15:42\nthis is a proposal that goes to gimbal ABS I I'm asking for an funding funding\n1:15:47\nfrom gimbals no from galops to fund these two deps and these two deps will start to to work with d te what is the\n1:15:55\nrational behind that um I see the the the rational is\n1:16:03\nU galab andamio is a as many other\n1:16:08\nprojects in the ecosystem has some specific needs in the front end u in the\n1:16:14\nfront end side andamio and imelaps has a kind of relationship and they can provide in the\n1:16:21\nshort and in the medium term some kind of mutual service Services if gimbal apps has success in the in providing the\n1:16:30\nthe services to the companies that they have to to to to they have to provide\n1:16:38\nall that benefit will go to to to the collective Collective\n1:16:44\nrecognition right and so what is the um how does it combine with the with the\n1:16:54\nsorry is an accelerator the with the with the overall idea of building the\n1:16:59\nthe capacity of of um front end developers and\n1:17:05\necosystem yes the the main goal of this of this of this proposal is build is to\n1:17:10\nbuild our own capacity of provide services to other projects galops in\n1:17:16\nthis case andamio is one of the projects that that we have at hand in this moment and they I have to say I'm part of gamia\n1:17:24\nand many others here are part of and right so we are available to\n1:17:32\ncoordinate the activities necessary to provide the\n1:17:37\nexpertise ER H to the developers all the\n1:17:42\nthe the space that they need to exper the gimbal apps deps will need to\n1:17:48\nexperiment in in this clients or this incubation relationship\n1:17:58\nright so is the idea that the two developers um would would help with the\n1:18:08\nincubator or like I'm just trying to connect the resources that are going in there with\n1:18:14\nthe overall goal right like how how does it connect to the\n1:18:21\nincubator yeah um okay if you want you can put the\n1:18:28\nclarifying questions in the document and I can I can start to to to to answer those questions but in a nutshell uh in\n1:18:37\na nutshell this uh this funded developers from gimbal\n1:18:43\nABS that will work with andamio um will attend the andamio will\n1:18:49\nbe the first client of gimbals in this in this in this in this incubation\n1:18:57\nwork uh from that we will gather data about what's happening how how we go the\n1:19:02\nprocess how the process work work in and start to take some decisions about it uh\n1:19:10\nmy invitation is to just read the proposal the entire proposal and just\n1:19:16\nplease put the there the objections and questions you could have\n1:19:27\nyes and uh thank you yeah that's uh that's great Sebastian um and I will put in a little section for clarifying\n1:19:34\nquestions and then let's uh let's quickly do a round of uh this is sort of\n1:19:40\na response like it's not for objections or or but it's like clarifying questions\n1:19:46\nor uh just uh your feeling um let's we can make it short we do I do want to\n1:19:51\ngive us a few minutes to sign out or to check out um let's start up at the top of my list uh James and then we'll skip\n1:19:59\nover Sebastian and uh Andrew um yeah I'm excited to see how\n1:20:05\nthis proposal evolves and it reminds me of other things we've done in the past right trying a new pattern um to see\n1:20:12\nwhat products it might emerge so yeah I'm excited thanks Seb for writing\n1:20:17\nit Well Done uh Andrew and then Adrian uh yeah uh think that's an\n1:20:25\ninteresting proposal actually um yeah um sorry I've not really got\n1:20:30\nmuch else to say on it I'm just I'm interested uh yeah I like I like the sound of it yeah it all sounds positive\n1:20:36\nso we'll see how it goes and uh Adrian and then Emanuel\n1:20:44\nsounds like a really interesting proposal thanks\n1:20:49\nup and Emanuel then Hara\n1:20:54\nyeah uh it's it's a very great uh proposal yeah yeah uh it's uh we know\n1:21:00\nhow uh you know um on K development there's been a lot of backend Works\n1:21:07\ngoing on and I think this is uh this is uh a very interesting proposal and\n1:21:13\nobviously I was uh I've been uh so much interested uh but uh I tried front end\n1:21:20\nbut I think I'm feeling in front end uh pretty early bad so yes uh yes it's a\n1:21:25\nvery nice yes excellent thanks Manuel thanks I have I just want to say my intention in\n1:21:32\nthis session was just share the proposal I was not aspiring to okay get the the\n1:21:38\napproval today but the first step is to share my my my intentions here and\n1:21:44\nthat's it yeah uh yeah for sure for sure um but let's I I I'm loving this these\n1:21:50\nthese uh coming up with these questions um Harsha and then um\n1:21:55\nMar so uh I actually was speaking to Newman about this like my initial\n1:22:01\nthoughts are that the way we think about front end in the age of AI is going to\n1:22:07\nbe different I think Theory becomes extremely important so I think if we focus on Theory the rest of it can be\n1:22:15\nautomated that's just my opinion yeah\n1:22:20\nyeah um okay thank you Hara that's a great Point Martin and then\n1:22:26\nmix yeah do stuff great do stuff love\n1:22:34\nit and mix and then Nelson yeah I do agree with this\n1:22:39\nproposal actually the the idea of uh being incubator or supporting developers\n1:22:47\nor even creating a Marketplace for developers uh or you know being kind of\n1:22:53\njob shadowing something we talk throughout several years of running\n1:22:58\ngimbal ABS about all these ideas um so yeah let's try maybe this is a year that\n1:23:06\ngimal ABS uh will use its community so that the community will get\n1:23:14\nbenefits in different ways that we were doing in uh past so sure I completely\n1:23:23\nsupport uh proposal such proposal and also uh I can see that we have other\n1:23:30\nneeds in the ecosystem so sure it's a front end but smart contract developer\n1:23:35\nback end or even system design so there are peoples out there that uh they have\n1:23:41\nsome ideas but they cannot conceptualize that because they don't have the enough\n1:23:46\ntechnical uh ideas or I don't know technical capability to you know\n1:23:52\njust uh think that idea into this blockchain space or\n1:23:57\neven cardano I mean they have something in ethereum they don't have and actually\n1:24:02\nI've seen many proposal Catalyst proposal that they have lacking these people and they seek these people so\n1:24:10\nyeah I think this would be a great start for doing that uh\n1:24:16\nhopefully uh we we will see great uh and I don't know like great proposal as\n1:24:22\noffspring of these proposal perfect thank you mix and Simon uh we we\n1:24:30\njust have one minute left um I do know that we we kind of have a weird hard\n1:24:35\nstop because we go to the next uh Tech standup but I do want to close this one out so Simon maybe you want to mention\n1:24:42\nyour question real quick and then we'll and then we'll close it\n1:24:47\nout or we can we can yeah yeah just still a bit unclear about how to\n1:24:55\ndevelopers uh working on theam website will help build a front end\n1:25:02\nincubator but yeah yeah okay um and Sebastian let's uh if uh let's answer\n1:25:11\nthat question on the um on the notion and this will be like a little teaser um\n1:25:18\ntoh come back to this proposal and see uh how it's answered in the future\n1:25:23\nbecause we are at time um yeah right and I just want to say I I agree with like\n1:25:29\nwe do need froment developers I also see it in our team and I think like when I\n1:25:35\nwas at the at the convention I heard from I think two other teams actually they would need from developers so it is\n1:25:42\nyeah it is great to hear that you guys are doing something about that for sure for\n1:25:48\nsure cool um harsh uh uh\n1:25:54\nthanks Sebastian Harsha any uh any last words have we forgotten anything or are we ready to shut down no I I thought\nFinal words and closing.\n1:26:01\ntoday was like the most efficient Open Spaces we've went through like so much so that was great yeah it's all you man\n1:26:07\nit's all you it's all you you don't you have no paraa is like the duck he's the duck\n1:26:14\nfeet under the duck I'm the duck I'm the top of the duck paraa is the bottom of the duck I maybe I don't\n1:26:20\nknow there's just too many things that rhyme with duck\n1:26:26\nall right y'all um I am G to hang up my hat and we'll start in on the tech standup I don't do we go to we don't go\n1:26:32\nto a different one I think we just we take a little break generally uh you guys have been at it for a while now and\n1:26:39\nthen we'll start up stay right here do people should we take a 49 or 14 minute break any anybody feel\n1:26:48\nstrong way like the only even number is four so I'll pick four four minute break oh my\n1:26:54\ngod oh on a 9 minute break let start at 1210 10 after all right 10 after 10\n1:27:00\nafter yeah we'll pick it up at 10 after this hour so nine minutes from now uh we'll get going I'm G to stop this\n1:27:06\nrecording um and yeah see you soon everybody thanks everybody Bute",

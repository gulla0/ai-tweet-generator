    "content": "Intro and how Open Spaces works\n0:02\nhello hello hello thank you for joining us uh you have just tuned in to the\n0:08\nMarch 13th edition of the gimbal labs open spaces uh community meeting this\n0:14\nmeeting is open to everyone uh we're glad that you joined us I'm going to give you a little rundown of what we do\n0:20\nhere uh typically every Thursday around this time which is 14 something\n0:28\nUTC um possibly and uh we are a\n0:34\ncommunity of Learners and typically we're building\n0:40\nand doing little our projects but on Thursdays we sort of put on our administrator hats and we\n0:48\ndo I wouldn't it's governance but uh it's uh we we uh work through our\n0:55\nprojects and we kind of get into the executive function we do a consent decision making process based Loosely on\n1:03\nthe S3 sociocracy 3.0 model and there is a notion board that\n1:12\nI'm going to share right now or uh Hara oh I'm I'm facilitating my name is\n1:19\nNewman uh I'm co- facilitating uh with Hara say hello Harsha\n1:25\nhey right hey Harsha I'm GNA share my screen\n1:30\nand I wonder if uh let's see we'll go through our agenda for today and the agenda is is\n1:40\nbased on these projects and this notion board can everybody see the notion\n1:47\nboard yes okay perfect\n1:53\num this is sort of how we manage things here in gimbal labs and\n2:00\nuh there are proposals anybody is welcome to create a proposal um the the\n2:06\nprojects look like this when they come off of the boiler plate C out of the\n2:11\npress um it's a title and all this sort of stuff you can just write in your idea\n2:17\nin this format and it goes into a uh a pipeline starts with these\n2:23\nproposals um and then it goes to sort of planning a backlog of ones that are are\n2:30\nare sort of on the back burner and then today we go to this community review and\n2:36\nconsent that's what we're here for and so this is our um this is our agenda for\n2:45\ntoday to go through some of these proposals and one of the cool things you can do\n2:52\nin uh in uh in noce is you can move things\n2:58\naround and so this is our idea for today is to talk about this first one uh the\n3:04\nwitch spaces January through June 2025 this one is important uh harsh you want\n3:09\nto explain why this one is important for today absolutely so uh for f-13 sustain\n3:17\nand maintain gimal Labs proposal uh we submitted the first Milestone and we submitted the WID spaces proposal as one\n3:24\nof the things that was consented on but the reviewers were very specific about\n3:31\nwhere the consent was uh and I have to answer to them so I was thinking we could get to the consent one way or the\n3:37\nother and then we can submit it to the review so that we can get through Milestone one and get the payment and\n3:43\ndistribute it to whoever needs it yeah perfect perfect and it's basically and I\n3:50\ncan pull that up but it it basically the Milestone reviewers was saying hey there's some a few specific things and I\n3:57\nremember one of those was who uh will cons who will commit to host and\n4:02\nfacilitate these these spaces uh in our next in then in the next uh few months\n4:10\nis that right\n4:15\nyeah um okay so that's the one that we're going to start first so I'm giving you sort of the agenda and then we're\n4:22\ngoing to talk about then we can decide whether we want\n4:27\nto go through this uh this marketing plan uh which kind of was a\n4:35\nspinoff of this wi spaces because we we were we thought that the the marketing\n4:41\nitself should have its own own proposal uh and then something that is uh\nGimbalabs DRep vote on “Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%”. Final vote: abstain.\n4:47\nsomething that I've really focused on this week is this um the the DP vote as you know gimal\n4:57\nLabs is also a DP so a uh our community is a community of learners but we're\n5:02\nalso a constituency and vote as a as a DP and the in the cardano governance I\n5:09\ndo want to call out and ask Scott um I he took the initiative um uh and is\n5:19\nfocused on if you don't know Scott ratio um he is he is his own D and he's\n5:26\nfocused in on on the on Community governance um and he went through this\n5:33\nuh proposal format and drafted um some great things the things that I want to\n5:39\nhighlight are the pros and cons and this is where we could have a good\n5:45\ndiscussion uh around this um\n5:51\nproposal uh all right so that is by way of agenda there two hands up uh new adri\n6:00\nand Sebastian sorry oh okay um Adrian Adrian yeah go ahead wouldn't it\n6:08\nwouldn't it make more sense to um have the vote proposal first because SC has\n6:13\nto drop off in 20 minutes so we wouldn't make much sense\n6:19\nto discuss a proposal where the owner is not present yeah that's true yeah that's true um we\n6:27\nhad we well actually it does actually that does make sense if we want to discuss that for the next 20 minutes\n6:32\nbecause because then we'll just we'll have a hard stop at 11 when Scott takes off um how do you feel about\n6:40\nthat sounds good to me yeah actually that does sound good um uh and let's uh\n6:48\nlet's begin that discussion now all right\n6:55\nso has everyone does every can everyone one can they see my screen or is uh who\n7:02\nhas not seen this proposal or does not know anything about it the first part of\n7:07\nthe consent decisionmaking process uh and it sort of looks like\n7:14\nthis oh boy um uh is basically reading and\n7:21\nunderstanding this uh what the vote is all about um is anybody\n7:27\nunclear I mean who who has some some questions about what this governance\n7:32\naction is about uh I I don't know what the treasury tax is so Scott if you\n7:38\ncould just give us like a a basic summary about what treas tax is and how\n7:44\nit affects like the everyday cardo user that'd be really awesome oh man that'd be great yeah my understanding on the\n7:52\ntax that I believe is T is actually to in the uh um in the parameters for cardano and\n7:59\nit's supposedly a tax that goes to the treasury from all transaction fees and also I believe from the reserve the\n8:07\ncardono reserve that's released at um three I guess it's 3/10 of whatever the\n8:13\nremaining uh Reserve is is released every every epic and so 20 so it's it's 20% goes to\n8:23\ninto the treasury essentially 80% of of rewards goes out to the spos and then that's\n8:30\ndistributed to the to the stakers um through the through those that stake to\n8:36\nthe spos as rewards um now cardono Foundation wrote a white\n8:42\npaper on it and they claim that it's closer to 32 and a half to\n8:47\n35% um but then also in the same breath cardano actually found the proposal\n8:54\nunconstitutional so um that's it I mean if you have any other questions on I'm not expert expert on tow I did my own\n9:00\nresearch on it and Tred to come up with my own formulas and models to help determine how it would impact cardano\n9:06\nbut that's much harder than I anticipated I'm sorry I just wanted to\n9:12\nask about that study that you're referring to or what do you mean with it's closer to do you mean the tax\n9:19\nitself is closer to 30% yes that's what that's what cardano\n9:24\nFoundation is stating in their white paper I me I can I can dig it up and put a link to it in theuh chat\n9:30\nyeah if you have it that would be amazing sure give me a second I'll get it to you excellent and so so that's a\n9:38\nthat's an important question to ask about like what what is this what is this tax and where does it come from\n9:44\nwhen you read the the the governance action material here\n9:53\num it can give you some some clue as to where it is but it does require some uh\n10:00\nsome thought and I know that that uh that Scott as a d uh you know has his\n10:06\nown opinion and everybody has their opinion uh and I think I think that Scott was thinking of voting yes but I\n10:15\nin the Discord we we heard from Adrian who had a strong um opinion as well and\n10:22\nso I wanted to see if Adrien could uh could come up and sort of you know help\n10:29\nto help us to understand the proposal um from that perspective so the treasury um\n10:37\nfunds are going into to developers or yeah there are for um yeah building the\n10:44\nkadano protocol and also to Catalyst and I think as G gims we definitely cannot\n10:53\nvote uh yes to cut the rate because all our funds are coming from that treasury\n10:58\nmore or less it wouldn't make sense to yeah cut ourself our own funds\n11:07\noff right I mean I kind of feel like I think that that's sort of I mean does\n11:16\nthat let's see uh because this is where this is where catalyst is funded with\n11:21\nthis with this 20% of the of the Dow\n11:27\nexactly um okay Simon has his hand up okay thank\n11:33\nyou yes Simon what do you got what I understand is that\n11:39\num that the that some of the funds would go\n11:45\nrather to the spos right right\n11:52\nyeah you mean not the treasury funds are going to the sbos the uh cut so the 10%\n12:00\nthat right would go to the treasury would then go to the SOS and also sure\n12:05\nto ourself if we are staking to the spos right but chimber laabs has its own\n12:12\nStak pool as well no right right I mean I still agree that with\n12:20\nwith the point I think chimber labs mix more through uh Grant\n12:26\nbut I mean what do I know but that's my strong suspicion yeah I mean if you go\n12:32\nto the projects page then only income is from Catalyst and all the proposals uh\n12:38\nor projects are funded because of catalyst\n12:44\nright yeah that is true and I think that that's a that's an important point is\n12:50\nthat gimal laabs is is funded indeed uh from this you know tax or the\n12:59\nthe way I've always explained is it's the physics of the blockchain that whenever we make a\n13:05\ntransaction portion of that uh whenever there's any activity portion of that goes into this Treasury and a portion of\n13:11\nthat treasury goes to Catalyst and a portion of that Catalyst funds goes to\n13:17\ngimal apps and is uh is paying me and and Harsha right now right now um which\n13:24\nis great which is great um some of the pros and cons\n13:30\nuh so if you have access and let me share\n13:36\nthis um link if you have access you can put a comment into this\n13:45\num into this uh message uh into this notion page\n13:52\nwe'll put that out there [Music]\n14:00\nokay so I think Simon is your hands still up do you have more comments or\n14:07\nokay so I want to do this as an S3 thing we have only only have about five more\n14:14\nminutes so I want to just get uh a temperature check and a quick clarifying\n14:22\nround uh do you feel like so here's the question as we do a around um do you\n14:28\nfeel like like we like you need more information or do you have like an\n14:33\nopinion I don't want you to say your opinion uh because this isn't because we don't have enough time to sort of at\n14:39\nthis moment uh uh to discuss opinions but I just want to get your sense of\n14:44\nlike oh yeah this is important I want to talk more about it or or or not um so we'll have a quick round um\n14:53\nI oh I feel\n14:59\nnow the question is kind of hard for me I feel I feel like I have enough\n15:04\ninformation to make an informed consent um like I don't I don't need to\n15:10\nask any more clarifying questions um James how how about you do you feel you\n15:16\nknow do you have like any kind of reaction or you feel like you have enough information I have enough\n15:24\ninformation okay cool Adrian um I'm uh\n15:30\nAdrian and then Andrew yeah yes I have enough information yeah okay perfect\n15:36\nperfect Andrew and then\n15:43\nEmanuel uh Andrew do you feel like you've got you know like you have a strong opinion or\n15:49\ndo you feel like you want you have enough information or or if there's something that uh you you want to bring\n15:54\nup Andrew okay we're going to move on to Manuel and then\n16:05\nARA okay Emanuel came off mute but I can't hear you you can put it\n16:12\nin the chat also and that might help us if you right now oh yeah we got you\n16:17\nbuddy okay yeah sorry uh so what I was saying is whatever that uh would be\n16:24\nhelpful to gimal Labs uh indirectly uh it should be considered that I think uh\n16:29\nScott mentioned um on uh the rational sorry I don't know um on what he thinks\n16:37\nis going to be helpful to gims in um um this um when um there's a decision\n16:45\non um the decrease of Treasury tax uh which is indirectly helping gimal laabs\n16:52\nin you know in the funding process so yes I think we should move on with that\n16:59\nokay okay yeah um paraa and then\n17:05\nMartin uh I I feel like I have enough information not that I can make a Deion\n17:11\nbut I think I have enough information and also I understand that gimal ABS currently depends on Catalyst but I\n17:18\npersonally I don't want the status quo to continue uh I really hope like we can be self- sustainable and not depend on\n17:25\nexternal organizations yeah a good point that's a good point um Martin and then\n17:32\nMonique I'm uh listening with a half ear so okay all right listening nice uh\n17:40\nMo'Nique and then Nelson so I honestly I'm catching up to\n17:46\nspeed a little bit I I I think I understand what's happening here and our\n17:51\nparticular position being funded by cadas but um I think that so the overall\n17:57\nlike purpose or or goal of of of this proposal um it was it's to increase hold\n18:06\non this is uh is to it's justified by uh increased staking uh returns and um\n18:14\npromoting decentralization I and I think that's like that's supposed to be the the\n18:20\nbenefit correct am I getting that right okay yeah okay yeah okay so I I I I\n18:26\nunderstand and um I have enough information I am perfect yeah perfect\n18:32\nthank you um Nelson and then\n18:37\nScott um yeah I also have enough information to understand proposal um\n18:43\nyeah and I have an opinion about it okay okay cool cool um let's go to Scott\n18:51\nScott I definitely know just to hear your voice though buddy yeah I've got enough information I just I do want to\n18:57\nlet everybody know that I'm not trying to sway a decision either of the way for gimal abbs um and I don't know if my\n19:03\napproach to this proposal was correct because I've never written a proposal for gimbal ABS so um anyway that's that\n19:09\nbut yeah I have enough information thank you excellent yeah and I do want to I do want to highlight that uh as I see James\n19:16\nwith the hand clapping this um you know we're not you know the consent a consent\n19:22\nprocess like this is making like a a civil container um I do want to recognize that Scott took the initiative\n19:29\nto sort of take on this with some with some you know uh uh um it was difficult\n19:36\nhe expressed how difficult it was because there's sort of conflict of interest and he's very uh fastidious or\n19:43\nvery uh like he he takes it very seriously this this sort of conflict of\n19:49\ninterest and and trying to be a representative uh and he does this more just to get the ball rolling and\n19:57\nlikewise I want to um acknowledge Adrien who was able to give like a good\n20:02\nCounterpoint like we have this phrase about getting to the no and that a no or\n20:08\nan objection is really a gift because that gives us the the space to sort of work these things out um so we're not\n20:15\ntrying to say this is right or this is wrong we're just trying to go through a process to sort of ascertain the thing\n20:21\nokay okay um uh Sebastian and then\n20:27\nSimon yeah I having information perfect so you got it the\n20:32\nbest um\n20:40\nSimon got oh yeah that's right he's already done um okay so I know that I\n20:46\nknow that Scott has to like he has to like be closing the door at uh 11 of his\n20:51\nhouse so um God do um I guess we can asked I one\n21:01\none of the unfortunate things about this is that the the window to vote is uh is\n21:06\ncoming up uh quickly um we I do W to I I do want to even\n21:16\nthough you may not be able to stay um I do want to get Adrian and\n21:25\nNelson um and Adrian you've kind of given your sort of your your uh uh your\n21:30\nobjection meaning and I think it was clearly stated that uh that look gimbal\n21:35\nLabs depends on catalist funds funds from that that tax uh is from there so\n21:42\nuh is that sum up the the argument that's one of\n21:49\nmys uh I would have some more but I don't think we have time for that yeah I\n21:55\nknow it's so it's so bad to uh so so Scott before you have to leave and I I\n22:00\njust want to do you want to um Le let's let's get your voice in here uh before\n22:06\nyou have to go on which\n22:13\nside um let's uh yeah what do you think about that and I know that this you know\n22:20\nbecause you know you don't you have a strong opinion for yourself but as gimble Labs uh you know I think it's\n22:26\nreasonable that that that tax comes from do you have anything that that sort of\n22:32\nhelps us understand better that are we seeing that clearly uh that you know that we're really funded by this tax and\n22:38\nthat you know that a vote on no to to keep the tax as it is is is probably\n22:43\nbest for for gimal labs yeah on that I don't know if it's best like I I don't know gimal Labs um\n22:52\nthey're budget where their funds come from or the economy of the uh Stak pool that is operated so\n22:59\nuh but if if indeed if indeed the the treasury is paying for the uh proposals\n23:04\nthat are funded um that I can see the impact on that if they were to decrease\n23:09\nthat um but gimal ABS also isn't the only entity or organization that is also\n23:15\nreceiving funding from the treasury so by and I'm playing Devil's Advocate so\n23:20\nby PL by by voting no because gimal lab's funding gets there is from there\n23:27\nyou're also pretty much giving a pass to every other project that's getting funding whether or not they're efficient\n23:33\nuseful or of the same so\n23:38\nand I as far as gimal abbs goes like I said I I will abstain anyway since I'm a d and I've already placed my vote and\n23:45\njust trying to play Devil's Advocate with the uh justification just mention yep all right and and Sebastian has his\n23:54\nhad his hand up I missed it twice sorry about that Sebastian no no no I prefer to to to\n24:00\nstate something about this this thing of\n24:06\ngimbals has catalyst is the only option to F gimal UPS in when I present my\n24:13\nproposal because I want I have a proposal to present today if we have the\n24:19\ntime but in general term in general terms I I think um it's a fact today but\n24:25\nuh for in that sense we have to move the organization or the this this exercise\n24:33\nto to another scenarios okay yeah thanks yeah I I definitely I definitely\n24:41\nagree um uh that yeah and then uh Simon I see that your hands up yeah I think\n24:49\nthere's\n24:54\num oh you you muted uh sorry yeah I just sat down the\n25:00\ncomputer and unmuted myself on the computer so I heard myself twice um yeah so I just wanted to make one more point\n25:06\nabout it which is I think it's an unfortunate timing to have it right now because everything with the budget is\n25:12\ncoming up I think it would have been better to have raised the question after the budget has gone through or yeah\n25:20\nmaybe before all the the budget craziness yeah I I think I I couldn't\n25:27\nvote any other way other than than no in this case but I can see like maybe in\n25:33\nthe future if it happen if it comes up again I could see myself vote Yes\n25:39\nactually interesting yeah yeah that is interesting and I'm gonna say goodbye to Scott and thank you so much for bringing\n25:46\nthis up and really taking the lead with h the the D role here Scott um it's really really been\n25:52\nincredible um okay uh so Andrew yeah Andrew we haven't heard from you\n25:59\nyou yeah sorry about that I think it was going to be my turn the internet dropped out I was really frustrating um so if\n26:07\nwe're still talking about this vote I'm inclined to go no um my reason is is uh\n26:14\non the face of it that sounds good to be as a Staker that you may get some extra rewards but there's a couple of things\n26:21\nuh I think James last week mentioned made a very good point about it's pretty disingenuous to label it as a t\n26:29\nbecause yeah the money stays in the ecosystem when when that money um gets\n26:35\npaid out to spos we don't know where that goes where that a goes that's fair enough that's\n26:40\nyou know their reward keep propping up the ecosystem but the the AER from the\n26:48\nto stays in the treasury which we as a part of cardano get to choose where\n26:55\nit goes and that's kind of what a lot of this governance is going to be about so to call it attacked I think is is a bit wrong um and then the other thing I look\n27:01\nat is the proponents of this um proposal in the first place seem to be mostly\n27:07\nmultipool operators um I'm going to be careful with my words now I don't want to offend anyone but\n27:15\nuh multipool operators\n27:22\nwell I'm not as keen on the concept of it so um yeah as much as on face it it\n27:28\nwould seem good for me as a Staker to to to vote Yes I think it's all a bit disingenuous so I say no yeah okay um I\n27:40\nNelson Nelson I know that you had something and and we'll extend just a little bit but I definitely want to come\n27:45\nup and we we can make a make a motion or sort of propose and just say hey a yes\n27:51\nor a no and we can do it uh uh we can do it that way I think I feel like that\n27:58\nmight be okay at this at this point but I'll hear from Nels um yeah without talking about my\n28:05\nopinion I think this vote is not going through right because we're not meeting\n28:12\nthe Constitutional thresold for the uh yeah for the Constitutional committee so\n28:19\nI I'm not sure if we are spending good time here or not because I yeah uh we\n28:25\nneed um 67% thre for the vote to go through and three of\n28:32\nthem voted no and one of them voted abstain so I don't think this going\n28:37\nthrough yeah yes uh\n28:43\nSimon and thanks thanks Nelson that is a good point yeah I wanted to just make one\n28:49\nmore comment about the disingenuous thing because I agree totally agree with that when I read that I thought this was\n28:56\nnot not framed well and I think this goes also more importantly I think this goes\n29:02\nto towards the culture that we want to have do we want to have like a political class that frames things like that or do\n29:10\nwe want to have um like a genuine uh fact based discussion right on with the\n29:18\nterms that are that are actually accurate and that we that we should use\n29:24\nhere and TX is not the the name or the the the framing and the the wding that\n29:30\ncomes to mind when I when I think about this yeah I think that's uh I'm glad\n29:36\nthat you mentioned that I'm glad that this is something because when I read this I'm like wait a minute this is just this is um uh a campaign speeches and\n29:46\nand we need to really see we need to have better you know like and is that a\n29:51\nmy my question was is that something that we can do as a community to sort of\n29:56\ncall it out and then re reframe it to where we can really get a sense of what exactly it is\n30:04\num James I see your hands up and and to that point like and picking up from Nelson's question is this worth the time\n30:12\nthis may be an early example of a proposal that we are best\n30:18\nignoring right like voting no is to take it seriously in a certain way not voting\n30:25\nat all is a way of prag a atically recognizing that the threshold is not\n30:30\nbeing met anyway and it's a way of publicly declaring that this is a silly\n30:37\nproposal framed in a particular terms that really don't\n30:43\napply um and so yeah I you know I think it's good to have an active goal of being sure to vote on everything while\n30:51\nalso recognizing that maybe not voting will sometimes be an action in itself\n31:00\nyes so so we've got options yes no abstain and ignore ignore ignore seems\n31:08\ncoming to the surface as a possibility right here right right I in the go ahead\n31:18\njust um what what what happens if\n31:26\num if everyone one ignores it but like a few people is there a threshold\n31:33\nthat needs to be met well you can see right here the the\n31:38\nconstitutionality threshold already won't to be met yeah whether we agree with that or\n31:45\nnot this is a system that works in a certain way and the way the system has\n31:50\nalready resolved this question is that three of seven on the Constitutional\n31:57\ncommittee have already registered a motion that this is\n32:03\nunconstitutional right and so therefore just as pragmatic rational actors in\n32:09\nthis ecosystem how much time do we want to give to this otherwise ridiculous\n32:14\nproposal and we all right all right right and we can go we can be we can\n32:20\nmake a public statement we can post this video wherever we want to right so\n32:26\nthat's an option right and so it's not always going to be passive to not vote it's possible to not vote and say look\n32:34\nwe gave this the time it's worth it's really not worth the time right now I agree with Simon that there's a point in\n32:40\nthe future where a yes vote might make a ton of sense um but right now it's it's\n32:46\na distraction that pulls in a political discourse that only exists in some but\n32:52\nnot all countries and and some people who live in one of those countries countes brought their problems to the\n32:59\ntable and framed it this way right like how much so how much time do we want to give those guys how much do we want to\n33:05\nfacilitate that kind of discourse and I'm glad people already named that here right we don't we can choose as a norm\n33:12\nnot to engage in that way yeah yeah right I was asking more from a d\n33:19\nperspective is there you can also you can see that current result as well and\n33:26\nso what's what's the number of no votes from DS already um yeah no I'm asking is there a\n33:32\nthreshold like if there's only I don't know 5% voting yes and everyone else abstains is gonna go through Yeah well\n33:40\nyeah and and if you saw that happening you would spring into action and you would register a vote but that's not the\n33:47\ncase right now yeah right right okay so with that in mind I think we're ready to\n33:54\nbecause uh you're right and we do have very important business so I and\n34:01\nHarsha what do you think um I think I'm I'm ready to uh uh just to to take a\n34:08\nround and and um propose ignore from the from the gimal grabs gimal Labs\n34:16\nD I'm cool with that yeah okay so this will have a uh let's\n34:25\nhave like a a voting round uh uh do you have an objection to um\n34:32\nignore and I'll go down the line um I I have no objection to uh and uh to to\n34:39\nignore James and then Adrien no\n34:45\nobjections uh Adrian No Object objections let's save the transaction\n34:51\nfee beautiful uh Andrew and then Emanuel yeah no OB from\n34:58\nme Emanuel then Hara yeah I have no\n35:05\nobjection yeah same no objection Martin then\n35:12\nmix he's just Martin just might be listening in I uh I agree yeah mix and mo hey guys\n35:23\nuh yeah I have no objection and I guess uh it would be a good opportunity for\n35:29\nthem to do better yeah yeah yeah yeah for those reasons that we mentioned earlier I definitely I definitely think\n35:35\nokay uh Monique and then Nelson no objection okay perfect thank\n35:41\nyou Nelson then Sebastian yeah I have no objection nice\n35:46\nnice Sebastian then Simon no\n35:54\nobjection S no look at that now we celebrate thank you thank you\n36:00\nvery much for working through that I feel like I feel like that was the process working I'm going to I'm I'm\n36:06\ntapping the uh the celebrate button um thank you so\n36:11\nmuch all right so you know I I think I think\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Which Spaces\n36:18\nthat's beautiful because there's other projects to be done here let's get into which spaces and you know I'd invite you\n36:26\nto sort of move around you know uh shift gears over into um this uh this other uh\n36:35\nCommunity uh uh proposal James is the owner and Source um this as you know is\n36:42\nthe catalyst is our Catalyst funding we have these um this is an\n36:50\ninflow of uh uh of uh of\n36:55\nmonies and that doesn't have our flow in here well the Catalyst fun 13 proposal\n37:01\nwould provide the inflow and this will back outflow from it okay um James do\n37:09\nyou want to uhh take the helm and uh guide us through this I can uh I I'm sharing the screen so I can point us in\n37:15\nthe right direction yeah thanks and so this proposal is pretty well along um we I think we talked about kind\n37:24\nof the driver and and those details and people have a chance to look at it and I'll drop it in the chat right now just\n37:29\nin case people need to read through here is the public\n37:39\nlink um but yeah so the goal here is to um keep public spaces at gimal Labs\n37:48\ngoing um the sort of spaces for example that are gutted when people in power\n37:54\ndecide to give everybody else a tax break and uh privatize public services\n38:00\nbut we'll we'll leave that aside for now um we are in the business of keeping\n38:05\npublic spaces open that's what we do at gimal laabs and what we want to do is\n38:11\nalso be supporting facilitators to get better and better at their craft and the\n38:17\nway we do that is by making sure that we're using some of our budget to fund\n38:22\npeople for facilitating meetings and we have the beginnings of a of a network of people who are\n38:29\npracticing this so for example Harsha and Newman have taken on facilitation of\n38:35\nthis space a few times this year and when when I have the privilege of\n38:41\nhanding it off to them I get to be a participant again which is a role I\n38:46\nreally enjoy playing um and I get to learn a lot um because being a\n38:52\nfacilitator you see everything through a different lens you're on a different Newman you can probably relate to this from today you're on a different kind of\n38:58\nalert that prevents you from thinking through all the ideas clearly because you are serving the rest of the\n39:03\ncommunity and that's a really big deal and so to share this across our growing\n39:10\necosystem and to make sure we're placing value in it that's what this proposal does right it takes the spaces we that\n39:18\nhave emerged at gimal Labs that have evolved to their current state which you can see down below number seven there's\n39:25\na table that name the spaces that we keep going over a closed time frame this\n39:33\nproposal is only about the first half of 2025 running spaces through May and then\n39:43\nactually another thing this proposal kind of um gives us the option to do is\n39:49\nto take some time off after may I do think that some seasons of not having\n39:56\nmeetings but doing maybe deep work or hackathons together is something I would really like to explore maybe in June and\n40:04\nso that's why I I I'm not making any proposal about that formally right now\n40:10\num but at least this proposal ends in May so that we can set the stage to have\n40:15\nsome options for using time differently maybe during some months or seasons of the year um so what you can see in that\n40:22\ntable right we're going to keep running aen live coding on Tuesdays this proposal require re Ires no funding for\n40:28\nthat because that's a separately funded project cardano all things go we just\n40:34\nstarted mix uh facilitated the third session of that yesterday and it's\n40:40\nreally starting to have a flow and a voice I think that that that session got really good reviews from people as we\n40:47\nwere leaving there's this Open Spaces session um speaks for itself this is\n40:55\nwhat we do um and then following this session uh the we just added a gimal ABS\n41:01\nTech standup which kind of toes the line between what what later sessions of\n41:08\nplutus pbl live coding have done in the past right giving anybody a chance to show up bring questions or demos work on\n41:15\nstuff together um and it's a step towards um moving us into a season at\n41:23\ngimal ABS where we are building stuff more often and this is already happening so the esteria work is really running on\n41:31\nits own driven by the people working on that project the plutus pbl maintainers\n41:38\nwork has really stood for itself and as as this continues and\n41:44\nlater if we have time I have a request for proposals for a technical project\n41:49\nthat I would like to just bring to the group and and see if anybody wants to pick it up but as this continues to\n41:56\nhappen and we do have these you know in S3 we would call them circles right\n42:01\nself-organizing circles um something like a weekly standup where people can get together\n42:07\nshow off and ask each other questions I think becomes a really engaging thing and that's why we're trying that\n42:12\nexperiment so with this calendar right here down below you can see an estimate\n42:17\nof how many sessions would run Open Spaces I'd like to make this retroactive to\n42:23\nJanuary um and so this would be funding for January through May total of 18 sessions it says about 18 just because\n42:31\nit might be if if we cancel a few more of them for any number of reasons that would be like the most um all things go\n42:37\nwould max out at 11 sessions Tech standup would max out at 11 sessions so you can see we have about 40 sessions at\n42:46\na proposed rate of 200 Ada for facilitating each one and that's why\n42:52\nthis proposal is asking for 8,000 Ada from the gimal ABS treasury to facilitate these sessions plus a\n43:00\nthousand for just Catalyst reporting itself which is critical this helps people know what we've been doing and\n43:06\nand invites other people into the work a thousand I think it is good to put this\n43:12\naside just for continued R&D about how we report on these things right there's\n43:17\nthe Catalyst reporting that we have to do but how about a th Ada for just\n43:24\nexperimenting with the ways we tell the stories about these spaces to whatever\n43:31\nstakeholders we don't have to decide exactly how to use it but I think this is really good for anybody who wants to\n43:37\npick up kind of that storytelling piece um and then keeping the calendar up to date I can continue to take care of that\n43:44\njust as part of this and then when I brought this proposal last week it did\n43:49\nopen a really good conversation about marketing but just to keep things easy to manage from a proposal perspective I\n43:56\nse seated those notes into a new Doc so we don't have to make marketing the\n44:01\nscope of this proposal just to keep facilitation going uh but I think we\n44:07\nshould flesh out a marketing plan for anybody who's interested in it so those\n44:12\nare the most important updates I just copied the same table if if you're not familiar with linked or synced blocks in\n44:20\nnotion this is a really helpful way you can edit in one place um and it stays the same in the other so this is just a\n44:26\ncop um of the same table that's above so you can read it again when it comes to responsibilities right we just want to\n44:32\nhave facilitators for all of these sessions I think it's okay if there aren't names on them yet like so Tech\n44:39\nstandup you can see in April and May there's nobody assigned to that yet um\n44:45\nthe reason I'm fine keeping it blank is I'm happy to do it but I won't fill in\n44:50\nmy name until giving somebody else the chance to take it on um and Newman Hara\n44:56\nif you guys become the default for Open Spaces but other people have the option\n45:01\nof jumping in how would you feel about that I wouldn't mind that necessarily um\n45:08\nwe definitely are going to do uh next week and uh the week after that will be\n45:14\nthe uh but yeah we wouldn't I don't yeah we'll have to talk it with with over with ARA but yeah that could that could\n45:20\nwork and I like that having um we could say this is the default host um because\n45:27\none of the nice things about a giant Community is that you know things happen and and it's good to have people to fill\n45:32\nin and those Fillin spots can lead into the more default post so\n45:38\nyeah cool thank you yeah that's exactly how I'm thinking of it and it it echoes to what Scott said about writing the\n45:46\nprevious proposal we were talking about the DP vote like somebody has to do that first step right but but he made it\n45:53\nclear he didn't want to be seen as wanting to express a strong opinion he was trying to get a conversation started\n46:00\nand in a similar way a default host is there as a service not because they're\n46:06\ntrying to grab a rooll and keep it from anybody else but because it's good to know like okay if nobody else steps up\n46:12\nhere's who's going to do this but we can keep practicing offering the option to\n46:18\nother people and and eventually people do step up yeah y I think that that's and that that terminology I think is\n46:24\nreally great so responsibilities that's why these responsibilities aren't fully fleshed\n46:31\nout but I hope that makes sense to folks that they they are fleshed out but they're left open to keep that door open\n46:39\num and yeah potential risks I think it's worth it just to name right we're uncertain about the impact of these\n46:46\nspaces and some of it is you know some of it you could compare to planting a tree and and you're not going to see its\n46:51\nfruit for a long time obviously that's that's a nice story we can tell ourselves if we're not sure about our\n46:57\nimpact um but we we we maybe want to start looking for ways to decide whether\n47:04\nthese spaces are are delivering value and that's a really hard thing to do um and\n47:12\nso that's why it's good just to list some risks and mitigations just to say look we have questions we're we're we\n47:17\ndon't know the long-term import of this um but at least by reminding each other\n47:24\nof that we can stay open and and dedicated to like asking those questions so yeah I think that's I think\n47:31\nthis is pretty complete um and yeah I can pass it off to Newman to facilitate the process yeah so now the first thing\n47:39\nand if you recall our process the first round that we do is to and we can\n47:45\npopcorn style this it's like do you have questions that clarify not an opinion\n47:51\nwhether this should be funded or not necessarily at this stage but just uh there's something that uh we call it\n47:57\nclarifying questions and it's if you have in you have an informational\n48:03\nrequest of James the owner or the community at large uh harsh do that does\n48:10\nthat match where we're at in the process now sounds good yes yes\n48:16\nokay so and we'll do this popcorn style so if you have uh a clarifying question\n48:22\nuh just uh you can just jump off mute and and uh and speak or put it in the\n48:28\nchat arsha will mind the\n48:33\nchat okay so people feel we've done this we\n48:39\ndid we've done this process once before so we we we did this or they fund\n48:46\n12 um uh uh project Catalyst uh uh sustain\n48:53\nand maintain gimbal Labs proposal so it's should be pretty familiar\n48:58\neverybody's being quiet I'm feeling like it's pretty\n49:04\nestablished I do have I have a question and that is\n49:11\nprerequisites so is this a prerequisite for the\n49:17\nfacilitator James yes I forgot that I even added that here so yeah the idea\n49:22\nhere is um we are in we're moving all of these projects one by one into\n49:30\nandamio and so we could play with this concept like what what would somebody\n49:36\nhave had to do first before they could join as a facilitator for one of these\n49:44\nspaces right um and I don't think we have to fully answer that question now\n49:50\num it'll be an exciting moment if somebody we've never met before shows up\n49:56\nand says hey can I facilitate next week um I think we can save that question for\n50:01\nwhen it happens right for now anybody who's expressed interest in\n50:07\nfacilitation is at least known to others because they've showed up for a certain number of meetings so far um and so I\n50:13\nthink we can leave it like that and then on the technical side we've talked about this in the dev space the last few weeks\n50:19\nand this will be a continued thing um where we talk about like what are the prcts to joining any project that's\n50:27\napproved here but I don't think it has to be the scope of this proposal right right um yeah the for\n50:35\ninstance you wouldn't want somebody that doesn't have uh Tech and development\n50:40\nexperience you know hosting the the the tech standup meaning that the real value\n50:46\nin that is having an experienced person there to sort of guide uh I always like to think of them as uh computer lab\n50:54\nattendance like those guys knew so much stuff and if you just be friends with them order a pizza you're in you're\n51:03\nin uh you know one of the things about this facilitation that we're doing is uh\n51:08\nthe facilitators collective uh actually has a course and it's something that I've completed um okay any other\n51:17\nquestions um I can show\n51:23\nthe oh wait oh it's up at the top there is a budget workshop and so one of the\n51:28\nthings about when you read these you know you can really you can really go\n51:33\ndown and ask like go to the requirements and what it's asking um and and the\n51:40\nbudget is a big one um so in that vein I created this\n51:45\nspreadsheet and it is [Music]\n51:52\nhere and is the total budget well anyway this you know we can but so\n52:01\nwe're going to we're offloading the marketing and so this gets down to\n52:08\nzero um and so we're gonna this is a $10,000 um a 10,000 Ada um\n52:16\nrequest right okay\n52:22\nokay yeah I feel uh let's H let's Okay Bon\n52:31\nyeah respect to the pr Rex I think we can we can lower the the\n52:38\nbarrier asking for H taking the specific model the facilit the new facilitator\n52:44\nwant to want to facilitate right because it's really complicated to to push the\n52:51\npeople to take the whole L to gain that spot facility in\n52:57\nthings um we can okay maybe you want to I don't know you but the thing is I\n53:04\ndon't know you but you can you can participate so at least take the model that you want to\n53:10\nfacilitate and it's let's see from that right\n53:16\nright yeah yeah\n53:23\nexcellent paraa I think that our next our next process is are we to\n53:33\nOB objections and concerns yeah oh yeah uh does anyone have um concerns or\n53:42\nwant to frame the discussion here uh James is the owner and I'll and\n53:50\nI'll go down the line here Adrian and Andrew any\n53:57\nuh like a concern it's like anything that pops up sounds good\n54:03\nto me okay excellent thank you Andrew anything that's popping popping up to you that you want to\n54:09\nverbalize uh no no um I think this is a fair proposal and uh yeah shout out to\n54:16\neveryone who contributes around here and um you get uh yeah it's great place to\n54:22\nbe around nice um Emanual and then\n54:28\nHara concerns and objections no I have no objection to\n54:36\nthis uh because I was about to ask if this is the first time this is coming up\n54:42\nuh and uh I think said it was I think I\n54:47\nthink he said it was done in the last uh yeah it was done in the last F round so\n54:53\nyes uh so this is the way to about it yes no objection perfect perfect um harsh and\n55:02\nthen manual yeah uh no objections yeah uh Martin and then next thanks thanks uh\n55:10\nMara uh no objections cool mix and then Monique yep\n55:16\nno objection either okay cool Monique no\n55:22\nobjections thanks Nelson and then Sebastian no\n55:31\nOB no objections okay Simon so Simon asked\n55:37\nthat he had stepped away so this basically is our object objection round and it and it's where you know if you\n55:44\nhave any strong opinion um about whether we ex we adopt this proposal um uh this\n55:51\nis where you would would voice it it can also be a concern it's just like oh well maybe the this part needs to be uh\n56:00\nchanged yeah it's okay I don't I don't want to waste anyone's time on this we\n56:05\ngot all right all right I love it um yeah I think that we can um adopt this\n56:14\nproposal and I uh this proposal is adopted no objections all around hey\n56:20\ncelebration time I definitely want to get a screen something that celebrates\n56:26\nhere you know what I mean the T icon can only take you so far it's really it's it it\n56:32\nused to be so cool you know but now um and we can um oh oh wait a minute wait a\n56:39\nminute this is a little more so where we\n56:45\ngo here and we move this is it we move it right now\n56:53\nthis is satisfying wa wait don't we oh no we can do it here status\n57:00\nthis one two in progress and it goes down\n57:11\nhere right this one okay progress\n57:18\nhooray okay now so we're shifting gears again um oh we're going to move this\n57:26\nwant to backlog this one goes backlog done I I\n57:31\nthought it was it was we yeah we go to done yeah we go to\n57:37\ndone okay hooray all right that's our celebrate thing can we drag it you can\nA quick check, Proposal: Gimbalabs Marketing Plan.\n57:44\ncan we go like this you can okay I don't want to try it live on TV I think the uh the destination has to be open but yeah\n57:50\nit should work oh okay cool um now this one draft of the gimbal Labs marketing\n57:58\nplan now this one I don't think there's been progress on this one since last week I didn't\n58:04\nhave time to Fork it until today um okay but yeah we can Seb do you want to pick\n58:10\nup the marketing one now or should we save that one in the planning or\n58:18\nbacklog yeah I think I I think this guy and Shaggy Shaggy one wants to be in the\n58:27\nThe Proposal that I don't know we can we can ping him with a link to this yeah\n58:34\nyeah okay is he in\n58:40\nthe is he is oh not yet not yet he's not in\n58:47\nokay um but just taking a brief look at this one uh this one is the gimbal ABS marketing\n58:55\nplan and remember we took out some budget from the witch spaces into the marketing which I think makes a lot of\n59:00\nsense um so uh there is a lot that goes into marketing and I know Simon you has\n59:07\nhand up go ahead Simon yeah so I've been thinking about\n59:13\nuh about working on this for chimber labs with a friend of\n59:18\nmine um yeah but I'm not best friends with shagy so\n59:25\nI'm not sure if that is a good option anymore to be honest you don't\n59:31\nnecessarily only have to work with best friends you can work with everyone example I was gonna give I was\n59:38\ngonna tell har a bad joke I always joke around with har but do you have a a is there you guys are do well\n59:48\nyeah I I think yeah I I tried not not to get\n59:53\ninvolved with him I I think yeah I've been working with him on the uh\n59:58\nmarketing working group in intersect and it didn't it only hurt me I don't want\n1:00:04\nto be involved with him anymore yeah yeah however that's all I'm gonna say in this case I think we\n1:00:11\ncan you can prepare a proposal in the same way in the same area right in the same with the same topic and as\n1:00:18\nCommunity you can decide okay this this proposal has more sense to it's more aligned with the primary R of gimbal\n1:00:25\nabsur or shag's proposal or something like that this is a good this I think this is a good situation because we have\n1:00:32\nseveral people interested on on participating the marketing site but\n1:00:38\nwith a different different approach right that's valid so I invite you to to\n1:00:44\ntake the present a proposal so if if I were to do that I would need some um\n1:00:50\ninformation about the goals and the general strategy of chimol labs where\n1:00:55\ncan of I can I can help you I can have you har I don't know you can also I can\n1:01:00\nmake some notes right we can open a document a public document in in Ocean\n1:01:06\nand start adding adding some points there for everybody that wants to to be\n1:01:12\na proposal around marketing all right okay so I get I get in contact with you Sebastian and um you can refer me to the\n1:01:19\nnecessary information yeah I will open the I will open the document and I ping\n1:01:26\nyou when when this is ready and also I will ping to to\n1:01:32\nshaggi to when the document is ready right and everyone of you can can offer\n1:01:38\nthe do this their thing I don't know if if any of you guys\n1:01:44\nhave of girls have some some objection in the approach I think it's the most\n1:01:50\nmost the most fair for everybody yeah and now so this is draft\n1:01:56\nlike a marketing plan which I know that Simon has like a good amount of experience on based on his work with\n1:02:02\nintersect and some other things um but it also is fulfilling the responsibility\n1:02:08\nfor things that we've got written down here uh bringing people to the session\n1:02:13\num that that the that there's life and action on the social networks that we\n1:02:19\nhave a consistent open and live gimbal lab spaces um establishing workflows\n1:02:26\nlike a set of tasks and and times to do things as far as our promotion uh\n1:02:31\nannouncements in web hooks like calendaring um you know we talked about\n1:02:38\nsort of the automated tools um Twitter spaces uh just representing uh gimbal\n1:02:44\nlabs in the in the market uh uh reporting and tracking metrics so what I\n1:02:50\nsee is that there's actually a big ecosystem uh you know a department so uh\n1:02:56\nand it's in a decentralized way meaning that you know if you were to you know\n1:03:01\nthere may be something that you can do even you don't have to work really uh so closely with others um for instance this\n1:03:09\nMedia Kit maintenance the that feels like it's a a periodic thing uh as\n1:03:16\nopposed to um like a operational uh weekly maintenance of\n1:03:22\nmaking announcements which is basically what Sebastian does now um but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I I\n1:03:29\ndefinitely think there's a place for uh opport there are opportunities here\n1:03:37\num so Sebastian or Simon is your hands still up\n1:03:45\nor yeah uh what are the next actions here you know this it feels like we need\n1:03:52\nmore um more work to make it more\n1:03:57\ndefined is that is that a in fact in fact I don't have to we\n1:04:04\ndon't have to open a new document we can we can use this to add some notes at the\n1:04:09\nend of the at the end of the of the do okay\n1:04:15\nyeah yeah so we'll keep this one we'll keep this one in uh\n1:04:22\nconsent and uh uh could we in the 20 10 10 to 15 minutes we've got\n1:04:30\nleft uh which of these would be good to attack\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Gimbalabs Incubator and Accelerator. Phase 1: Front End Support.\n1:04:36\nnext i' like to share something about the galap in Creator that's a proposal\n1:04:42\nthat I want to to present today excellent that is that is yeah go\n1:04:48\nahead yeah let's do it okay this proposal is aligned with um what we are\n1:04:54\ndiscussing just a few moments about the the only\n1:05:00\nthe finance the funding sources of gimbals this is a a think an idea that I\n1:05:05\nhave had and I I I'm sure that I I was not the only one trying to\n1:05:14\nto to identify some another sources funding sources for for game Bops right\n1:05:22\nand this is this proposal is based on conversations that I I had the\n1:05:28\nopportunity to to have with ex students and ex dep students in in that took some\n1:05:38\nuh some some classes and lessons in the in\n1:05:43\nthe spaces in the gal spaces and their level of satisfaction H\n1:05:50\nER takes them to think that H seriously on make some donations to to galops in\n1:05:59\nexchange of the the pro the the activities educational activities we make here so and today we have we are in\n1:06:07\nthis ecosystem where the incubation and acceleration is taking a really good a really good first\n1:06:14\nstage and this is I think I think this is This falls into the the expertise of\n1:06:22\ngimbal UPS as Community organization so the thing is um building\n1:06:30\nincubator is a really big exercise it's a complex cace like that and in in that\n1:06:37\nsense we can H start for step by step um\n1:06:43\nidentifying um urgent Necessities in the ecosystem in the developer ecosystem and\n1:06:49\nstart to support some in in some way those kind of Necessities one of the the\n1:06:55\nthe most clearness needs in the uh needs\n1:07:00\nis the the frontend front end development the the the projects and startups in the ecosystem needs urgently\n1:07:08\nsome kind of support in the front side right and they have the budget they have the budget to to to support\n1:07:14\nto to to fund those kind of some kind of\n1:07:20\num um assistance and support in that way right but we have zero\n1:07:26\nH dep force in in in that front in that layer of the developer stack so my idea\n1:07:34\nwith this proposal is to um um start building this idea of uh\n1:07:41\nmaking galops an incubator and an accelerator\n1:07:46\num based on and and the first step the first step is to build a a a collective\n1:07:53\nI I call that in this in this in this proposal Collective Collective of frontend developers not expert\n1:08:00\ndevelopers just gimbal apps members that have some kind of a experience some kind\n1:08:07\nof a domain in the area of front end development sufficient to support a a\n1:08:15\ncardano projects right and we know cardano projects are really not too complex projects in some\n1:08:23\nway they they are complex in the back end but in the front end they are as as\n1:08:28\nusual as the web to web to U projects um so my proposal is first\n1:08:35\nstart taking a steps into build that kind of circle that would be would be a new Circle um a basic Circle a basic\n1:08:43\nsale of developers from developers gimbal UPS members that can provide some\n1:08:49\nkind of support on that right I was thinking for example on Hara Hara has has has experience in ux development I\n1:08:58\nwas thinking on Newman that has some kind of I don't know I'm I'm just I can\n1:09:03\nhave a a rudimentary knowledge about you guys about your experience but I think you have some kind of exper expertise on\n1:09:12\nwhat is around uh front end development around ux experience and all that stuff\n1:09:19\nand I think we can use that and and and on only talking about just\n1:09:26\nboth of you guys but this this is an invitation to everybody that has some\n1:09:31\nkind of expertise in front of development basic no matter the the the\n1:09:39\nlevel yeah an invitation uh so that's the first start building the the circle the circle the\n1:09:47\nfront and circle with this approach of a supporting front end ER supporting\n1:09:53\ncardano projects in the area of incubation right of incub of supporting supporting projects uh in the\n1:10:02\ndetails of the proposal I invite you to read The Proposal in these details you can see uh first is the calling of the\n1:10:10\nof the members interested in in in in in be part of the of the circle the second\n1:10:15\nis around this the the these first um sessions that allow to start clarifying\n1:10:22\nprocedures and uh driver mapping in general general terms and the thing we\n1:10:27\nhave a a a rabit test rabit know I'm saying that really well I proposed\n1:10:35\nandamio because andamio first is a I I I gave there the the the reasons why\n1:10:42\nandamio is a good Prospect to serve to this ex this first exercise as the the a\n1:10:50\nproject test that can can resist all our experiments around frontend development\n1:10:58\nsupport um in among those merits that I think are valuable first is was is a\n1:11:05\ncompany funded by many of the instructors and and and and teachers\n1:11:11\nthat voluntarily have provide services to galops for for\n1:11:17\nyears and I think it's that makes them a\n1:11:22\napt to receive some kind of support and currently andamio is supporting\n1:11:28\ngimbals in in in provide in providing the courses the several courses that we\n1:11:35\nare today h delivering to the students and the cardano ecosystem in general in\n1:11:41\nour Open Spaces I have to say I have to say this H this prop this this whole\n1:11:48\nproposal is align with the primary driver of the of gimbal because the primary driver talks about\n1:11:56\nbuilding spaces building new spaces right and we have in in in today we have\n1:12:03\ninternal and and and and really well known spaces but internally at kind\n1:12:11\nof a in our wellknown wellknown uh radar\n1:12:18\nbut I think we must to start testing the boundaries of these limits of our usual\n1:12:25\nradar and start to think on expanding our expanding our\n1:12:30\nour our area of action in terms of spaces I think we can go and start to\n1:12:36\nbuilding spaces outside of the of our traditional uh our traditional ER\n1:12:45\ntraditional field right and start to build in a kind of pipeline between our\n1:12:50\ninternal and well-known spaces and these spaces that are FOC fused on incubating\n1:12:56\nand supporting supporting projects we can build there a kind of pipeline that can communicate both intentions right\n1:13:04\nimagine for example a proposer or a a entrepreneur a cardan entrepreneur on an\n1:13:10\nN entrepreneur or a Solan entrepreneur etc etc that wants to start building on\n1:13:16\ncardano right he can come here to envelops and start taking the the the\n1:13:21\nour our sessions and then they can go to our our circles in charge of supporting\n1:13:30\nprojects in a specific areas in this case front end but with time depending of how this experiment goes we can start\n1:13:37\nsupporting projects in other areas in backing areas specific more more more\n1:13:43\nmore in technically intense areas so yeah that's right um I think we we\n1:13:51\nhave okay that's that general idea if we go to the scroll down the impact the\n1:13:58\nimpact talks about that uh we can start we can K starting our efforts\n1:14:05\nthrough a a gimbal UPS incubator right and as a gimbals incubator we can have\n1:14:12\naccess not only to the Catalyst funds but also to intersect funds but also to\n1:14:17\ndonations from the developers direct donations to gimbal apps from H the\n1:14:23\ndevelopers that receive support we can charge to those to those projects if\n1:14:30\nthey have the they have the they have received for example a catalis proposal or they have they have a catalis\n1:14:36\nproposal or an intersect proposal in course we can we can there in the scenario we have several ways of getting\n1:14:43\nfunds and getting income and from years we have had that g in gimbal apps this\n1:14:49\nidea of gimbal up Solutions where we provide H the project services in in\n1:14:55\ndifferent areas right this front endend Collective can be the first of the whole\n1:15:01\narray of services we can provide to the to the people\n1:15:06\nyes uh so I read through the through the proposal and I'm curious as to what is\n1:15:13\nthe connection between anio and I think they're providing 10,000 data right did\n1:15:19\nI get that right yeah we have a proposed as uh as you know in in the section uh resources\n1:15:27\nresources I'm asking 10,000 Adas for funding for for funding two deps for h\n1:15:35\ntwo months the ration okay so this is a proposal that goes to uh anio right no\n1:15:42\nthis is a proposal that goes to gimbal ABS I I'm asking for an funding funding\n1:15:47\nfrom gimbals no from galops to fund these two deps and these two deps will start to to work with d te what is the\n1:15:55\nrational behind that um I see the the the rational is\n1:16:03\nU galab andamio is a as many other\n1:16:08\nprojects in the ecosystem has some specific needs in the front end u in the\n1:16:14\nfront end side andamio and imelaps has a kind of relationship and they can provide in the\n1:16:21\nshort and in the medium term some kind of mutual service Services if gimbal apps has success in the in providing the\n1:16:30\nthe services to the companies that they have to to to to they have to provide\n1:16:38\nall that benefit will go to to to the collective Collective\n1:16:44\nrecognition right and so what is the um how does it combine with the with the\n1:16:54\nsorry is an accelerator the with the with the overall idea of building the\n1:16:59\nthe capacity of of um front end developers and\n1:17:05\necosystem yes the the main goal of this of this of this proposal is build is to\n1:17:10\nbuild our own capacity of provide services to other projects galops in\n1:17:16\nthis case andamio is one of the projects that that we have at hand in this moment and they I have to say I'm part of gamia\n1:17:24\nand many others here are part of and right so we are available to\n1:17:32\ncoordinate the activities necessary to provide the\n1:17:37\nexpertise ER H to the developers all the\n1:17:42\nthe the space that they need to exper the gimbal apps deps will need to\n1:17:48\nexperiment in in this clients or this incubation relationship\n1:17:58\nright so is the idea that the two developers um would would help with the\n1:18:08\nincubator or like I'm just trying to connect the resources that are going in there with\n1:18:14\nthe overall goal right like how how does it connect to the\n1:18:21\nincubator yeah um okay if you want you can put the\n1:18:28\nclarifying questions in the document and I can I can start to to to to answer those questions but in a nutshell uh in\n1:18:37\na nutshell this uh this funded developers from gimbal\n1:18:43\nABS that will work with andamio um will attend the andamio will\n1:18:49\nbe the first client of gimbals in this in this in this in this incubation\n1:18:57\nwork uh from that we will gather data about what's happening how how we go the\n1:19:02\nprocess how the process work work in and start to take some decisions about it uh\n1:19:10\nmy invitation is to just read the proposal the entire proposal and just\n1:19:16\nplease put the there the objections and questions you could have\n1:19:27\nyes and uh thank you yeah that's uh that's great Sebastian um and I will put in a little section for clarifying\n1:19:34\nquestions and then let's uh let's quickly do a round of uh this is sort of\n1:19:40\na response like it's not for objections or or but it's like clarifying questions\n1:19:46\nor uh just uh your feeling um let's we can make it short we do I do want to\n1:19:51\ngive us a few minutes to sign out or to check out um let's start up at the top of my list uh James and then we'll skip\n1:19:59\nover Sebastian and uh Andrew um yeah I'm excited to see how\n1:20:05\nthis proposal evolves and it reminds me of other things we've done in the past right trying a new pattern um to see\n1:20:12\nwhat products it might emerge so yeah I'm excited thanks Seb for writing\n1:20:17\nit Well Done uh Andrew and then Adrian uh yeah uh think that's an\n1:20:25\ninteresting proposal actually um yeah um sorry I've not really got\n1:20:30\nmuch else to say on it I'm just I'm interested uh yeah I like I like the sound of it yeah it all sounds positive\n1:20:36\nso we'll see how it goes and uh Adrian and then Emanuel\n1:20:44\nsounds like a really interesting proposal thanks\n1:20:49\nup and Emanuel then Hara\n1:20:54\nyeah uh it's it's a very great uh proposal yeah yeah uh it's uh we know\n1:21:00\nhow uh you know um on K development there's been a lot of backend Works\n1:21:07\ngoing on and I think this is uh this is uh a very interesting proposal and\n1:21:13\nobviously I was uh I've been uh so much interested uh but uh I tried front end\n1:21:20\nbut I think I'm feeling in front end uh pretty early bad so yes uh yes it's a\n1:21:25\nvery nice yes excellent thanks Manuel thanks I have I just want to say my intention in\n1:21:32\nthis session was just share the proposal I was not aspiring to okay get the the\n1:21:38\napproval today but the first step is to share my my my intentions here and\n1:21:44\nthat's it yeah uh yeah for sure for sure um but let's I I I'm loving this these\n1:21:50\nthese uh coming up with these questions um Harsha and then um\n1:21:55\nMar so uh I actually was speaking to Newman about this like my initial\n1:22:01\nthoughts are that the way we think about front end in the age of AI is going to\n1:22:07\nbe different I think Theory becomes extremely important so I think if we focus on Theory the rest of it can be\n1:22:15\nautomated that's just my opinion yeah\n1:22:20\nyeah um okay thank you Hara that's a great Point Martin and then\n1:22:26\nmix yeah do stuff great do stuff love\n1:22:34\nit and mix and then Nelson yeah I do agree with this\n1:22:39\nproposal actually the the idea of uh being incubator or supporting developers\n1:22:47\nor even creating a Marketplace for developers uh or you know being kind of\n1:22:53\njob shadowing something we talk throughout several years of running\n1:22:58\ngimbal ABS about all these ideas um so yeah let's try maybe this is a year that\n1:23:06\ngimal ABS uh will use its community so that the community will get\n1:23:14\nbenefits in different ways that we were doing in uh past so sure I completely\n1:23:23\nsupport uh proposal such proposal and also uh I can see that we have other\n1:23:30\nneeds in the ecosystem so sure it's a front end but smart contract developer\n1:23:35\nback end or even system design so there are peoples out there that uh they have\n1:23:41\nsome ideas but they cannot conceptualize that because they don't have the enough\n1:23:46\ntechnical uh ideas or I don't know technical capability to you know\n1:23:52\njust uh think that idea into this blockchain space or\n1:23:57\neven cardano I mean they have something in ethereum they don't have and actually\n1:24:02\nI've seen many proposal Catalyst proposal that they have lacking these people and they seek these people so\n1:24:10\nyeah I think this would be a great start for doing that uh\n1:24:16\nhopefully uh we we will see great uh and I don't know like great proposal as\n1:24:22\noffspring of these proposal perfect thank you mix and Simon uh we we\n1:24:30\njust have one minute left um I do know that we we kind of have a weird hard\n1:24:35\nstop because we go to the next uh Tech standup but I do want to close this one out so Simon maybe you want to mention\n1:24:42\nyour question real quick and then we'll and then we'll close it\n1:24:47\nout or we can we can yeah yeah just still a bit unclear about how to\n1:24:55\ndevelopers uh working on theam website will help build a front end\n1:25:02\nincubator but yeah yeah okay um and Sebastian let's uh if uh let's answer\n1:25:11\nthat question on the um on the notion and this will be like a little teaser um\n1:25:18\ntoh come back to this proposal and see uh how it's answered in the future\n1:25:23\nbecause we are at time um yeah right and I just want to say I I agree with like\n1:25:29\nwe do need froment developers I also see it in our team and I think like when I\n1:25:35\nwas at the at the convention I heard from I think two other teams actually they would need from developers so it is\n1:25:42\nyeah it is great to hear that you guys are doing something about that for sure for\n1:25:48\nsure cool um harsh uh uh\n1:25:54\nthanks Sebastian Harsha any uh any last words have we forgotten anything or are we ready to shut down no I I thought\nFinal words and closing.\n1:26:01\ntoday was like the most efficient Open Spaces we've went through like so much so that was great yeah it's all you man\n1:26:07\nit's all you it's all you you don't you have no paraa is like the duck he's the duck\n1:26:14\nfeet under the duck I'm the duck I'm the top of the duck paraa is the bottom of the duck I maybe I don't\n1:26:20\nknow there's just too many things that rhyme with duck\n1:26:26\nall right y'all um I am G to hang up my hat and we'll start in on the tech standup I don't do we go to we don't go\n1:26:32\nto a different one I think we just we take a little break generally uh you guys have been at it for a while now and\n1:26:39\nthen we'll start up stay right here do people should we take a 49 or 14 minute break any anybody feel\n1:26:48\nstrong way like the only even number is four so I'll pick four four minute break oh my\n1:26:54\ngod oh on a 9 minute break let start at 1210 10 after all right 10 after 10\n1:27:00\nafter yeah we'll pick it up at 10 after this hour so nine minutes from now uh we'll get going I'm G to stop this\n1:27:06\nrecording um and yeah see you soon everybody thanks everybody Bute",

    "content": "Intro and how Open Spaces works\n0:02\nhello hello hello thank you for joining us uh you have just tuned in to the\n0:08\nMarch 13th edition of the gimbal labs open spaces uh community meeting this\n0:14\nmeeting is open to everyone uh we're glad that you joined us I'm going to give you a little rundown of what we do\n0:20\nhere uh typically every Thursday around this time which is 14 something\n0:28\nUTC um possibly and uh we are a\n0:34\ncommunity of Learners and typically we're building\n0:40\nand doing little our projects but on Thursdays we sort of put on our administrator hats and we\n0:48\ndo I wouldn't it's governance but uh it's uh we we uh work through our\n0:55\nprojects and we kind of get into the executive function we do a consent decision making process based Loosely on\n1:03\nthe S3 sociocracy 3.0 model and there is a notion board that\n1:12\nI'm going to share right now or uh Hara oh I'm I'm facilitating my name is\n1:19\nNewman uh I'm co- facilitating uh with Hara say hello Harsha\n1:25\nhey right hey Harsha I'm GNA share my screen\n1:30\nand I wonder if uh let's see we'll go through our agenda for today and the agenda is is\n1:40\nbased on these projects and this notion board can everybody see the notion\n1:47\nboard yes okay perfect\n1:53\num this is sort of how we manage things here in gimbal labs and\n2:00\nuh there are proposals anybody is welcome to create a proposal um the the\n2:06\nprojects look like this when they come off of the boiler plate C out of the\n2:11\npress um it's a title and all this sort of stuff you can just write in your idea\n2:17\nin this format and it goes into a uh a pipeline starts with these\n2:23\nproposals um and then it goes to sort of planning a backlog of ones that are are\n2:30\nare sort of on the back burner and then today we go to this community review and\n2:36\nconsent that's what we're here for and so this is our um this is our agenda for\n2:45\ntoday to go through some of these proposals and one of the cool things you can do\n2:52\nin uh in uh in noce is you can move things\n2:58\naround and so this is our idea for today is to talk about this first one uh the\n3:04\nwitch spaces January through June 2025 this one is important uh harsh you want\n3:09\nto explain why this one is important for today absolutely so uh for f-13 sustain\n3:17\nand maintain gimal Labs proposal uh we submitted the first Milestone and we submitted the WID spaces proposal as one\n3:24\nof the things that was consented on but the reviewers were very specific about\n3:31\nwhere the consent was uh and I have to answer to them so I was thinking we could get to the consent one way or the\n3:37\nother and then we can submit it to the review so that we can get through Milestone one and get the payment and\n3:43\ndistribute it to whoever needs it yeah perfect perfect and it's basically and I\n3:50\ncan pull that up but it it basically the Milestone reviewers was saying hey there's some a few specific things and I\n3:57\nremember one of those was who uh will cons who will commit to host and\n4:02\nfacilitate these these spaces uh in our next in then in the next uh few months\n4:10\nis that right\n4:15\nyeah um okay so that's the one that we're going to start first so I'm giving you sort of the agenda and then we're\n4:22\ngoing to talk about then we can decide whether we want\n4:27\nto go through this uh this marketing plan uh which kind of was a\n4:35\nspinoff of this wi spaces because we we were we thought that the the marketing\n4:41\nitself should have its own own proposal uh and then something that is uh\nGimbalabs DRep vote on “Decrease Treasury Tax from 20% to 10%”. Final vote: abstain.\n4:47\nsomething that I've really focused on this week is this um the the DP vote as you know gimal\n4:57\nLabs is also a DP so a uh our community is a community of learners but we're\n5:02\nalso a constituency and vote as a as a DP and the in the cardano governance I\n5:09\ndo want to call out and ask Scott um I he took the initiative um uh and is\n5:19\nfocused on if you don't know Scott ratio um he is he is his own D and he's\n5:26\nfocused in on on the on Community governance um and he went through this\n5:33\nuh proposal format and drafted um some great things the things that I want to\n5:39\nhighlight are the pros and cons and this is where we could have a good\n5:45\ndiscussion uh around this um\n5:51\nproposal uh all right so that is by way of agenda there two hands up uh new adri\n6:00\nand Sebastian sorry oh okay um Adrian Adrian yeah go ahead wouldn't it\n6:08\nwouldn't it make more sense to um have the vote proposal first because SC has\n6:13\nto drop off in 20 minutes so we wouldn't make much sense\n6:19\nto discuss a proposal where the owner is not present yeah that's true yeah that's true um we\n6:27\nhad we well actually it does actually that does make sense if we want to discuss that for the next 20 minutes\n6:32\nbecause because then we'll just we'll have a hard stop at 11 when Scott takes off um how do you feel about\n6:40\nthat sounds good to me yeah actually that does sound good um uh and let's uh\n6:48\nlet's begin that discussion now all right\n6:55\nso has everyone does every can everyone one can they see my screen or is uh who\n7:02\nhas not seen this proposal or does not know anything about it the first part of\n7:07\nthe consent decisionmaking process uh and it sort of looks like\n7:14\nthis oh boy um uh is basically reading and\n7:21\nunderstanding this uh what the vote is all about um is anybody\n7:27\nunclear I mean who who has some some questions about what this governance\n7:32\naction is about uh I I don't know what the treasury tax is so Scott if you\n7:38\ncould just give us like a a basic summary about what treas tax is and how\n7:44\nit affects like the everyday cardo user that'd be really awesome oh man that'd be great yeah my understanding on the\n7:52\ntax that I believe is T is actually to in the uh um in the parameters for cardano and\n7:59\nit's supposedly a tax that goes to the treasury from all transaction fees and also I believe from the reserve the\n8:07\ncardono reserve that's released at um three I guess it's 3/10 of whatever the\n8:13\nremaining uh Reserve is is released every every epic and so 20 so it's it's 20% goes to\n8:23\ninto the treasury essentially 80% of of rewards goes out to the spos and then that's\n8:30\ndistributed to the to the stakers um through the through those that stake to\n8:36\nthe spos as rewards um now cardono Foundation wrote a white\n8:42\npaper on it and they claim that it's closer to 32 and a half to\n8:47\n35% um but then also in the same breath cardano actually found the proposal\n8:54\nunconstitutional so um that's it I mean if you have any other questions on I'm not expert expert on tow I did my own\n9:00\nresearch on it and Tred to come up with my own formulas and models to help determine how it would impact cardano\n9:06\nbut that's much harder than I anticipated I'm sorry I just wanted to\n9:12\nask about that study that you're referring to or what do you mean with it's closer to do you mean the tax\n9:19\nitself is closer to 30% yes that's what that's what cardano\n9:24\nFoundation is stating in their white paper I me I can I can dig it up and put a link to it in theuh chat\n9:30\nyeah if you have it that would be amazing sure give me a second I'll get it to you excellent and so so that's a\n9:38\nthat's an important question to ask about like what what is this what is this tax and where does it come from\n9:44\nwhen you read the the the governance action material here\n9:53\num it can give you some some clue as to where it is but it does require some uh\n10:00\nsome thought and I know that that uh that Scott as a d uh you know has his\n10:06\nown opinion and everybody has their opinion uh and I think I think that Scott was thinking of voting yes but I\n10:15\nin the Discord we we heard from Adrian who had a strong um opinion as well and\n10:22\nso I wanted to see if Adrien could uh could come up and sort of you know help\n10:29\nto help us to understand the proposal um from that perspective so the treasury um\n10:37\nfunds are going into to developers or yeah there are for um yeah building the\n10:44\nkadano protocol and also to Catalyst and I think as G gims we definitely cannot\n10:53\nvote uh yes to cut the rate because all our funds are coming from that treasury\n10:58\nmore or less it wouldn't make sense to yeah cut ourself our own funds\n11:07\noff right I mean I kind of feel like I think that that's sort of I mean does\n11:16\nthat let's see uh because this is where this is where catalyst is funded with\n11:21\nthis with this 20% of the of the Dow\n11:27\nexactly um okay Simon has his hand up okay thank\n11:33\nyou yes Simon what do you got what I understand is that\n11:39\num that the that some of the funds would go\n11:45\nrather to the spos right right\n11:52\nyeah you mean not the treasury funds are going to the sbos the uh cut so the 10%\n12:00\nthat right would go to the treasury would then go to the SOS and also sure\n12:05\nto ourself if we are staking to the spos right but chimber laabs has its own\n12:12\nStak pool as well no right right I mean I still agree that with\n12:20\nwith the point I think chimber labs mix more through uh Grant\n12:26\nbut I mean what do I know but that's my strong suspicion yeah I mean if you go\n12:32\nto the projects page then only income is from Catalyst and all the proposals uh\n12:38\nor projects are funded because of catalyst\n12:44\nright yeah that is true and I think that that's a that's an important point is\n12:50\nthat gimal laabs is is funded indeed uh from this you know tax or the\n12:59\nthe way I've always explained is it's the physics of the blockchain that whenever we make a\n13:05\ntransaction portion of that uh whenever there's any activity portion of that goes into this Treasury and a portion of\n13:11\nthat treasury goes to Catalyst and a portion of that Catalyst funds goes to\n13:17\ngimal apps and is uh is paying me and and Harsha right now right now um which\n13:24\nis great which is great um some of the pros and cons\n13:30\nuh so if you have access and let me share\n13:36\nthis um link if you have access you can put a comment into this\n13:45\num into this uh message uh into this notion page\n13:52\nwe'll put that out there [Music]\n14:00\nokay so I think Simon is your hands still up do you have more comments or\n14:07\nokay so I want to do this as an S3 thing we have only only have about five more\n14:14\nminutes so I want to just get uh a temperature check and a quick clarifying\n14:22\nround uh do you feel like so here's the question as we do a around um do you\n14:28\nfeel like like we like you need more information or do you have like an\n14:33\nopinion I don't want you to say your opinion uh because this isn't because we don't have enough time to sort of at\n14:39\nthis moment uh uh to discuss opinions but I just want to get your sense of\n14:44\nlike oh yeah this is important I want to talk more about it or or or not um so we'll have a quick round um\n14:53\nI oh I feel\n14:59\nnow the question is kind of hard for me I feel I feel like I have enough\n15:04\ninformation to make an informed consent um like I don't I don't need to\n15:10\nask any more clarifying questions um James how how about you do you feel you\n15:16\nknow do you have like any kind of reaction or you feel like you have enough information I have enough\n15:24\ninformation okay cool Adrian um I'm uh\n15:30\nAdrian and then Andrew yeah yes I have enough information yeah okay perfect\n15:36\nperfect Andrew and then\n15:43\nEmanuel uh Andrew do you feel like you've got you know like you have a strong opinion or\n15:49\ndo you feel like you want you have enough information or or if there's something that uh you you want to bring\n15:54\nup Andrew okay we're going to move on to Manuel and then\n16:05\nARA okay Emanuel came off mute but I can't hear you you can put it\n16:12\nin the chat also and that might help us if you right now oh yeah we got you\n16:17\nbuddy okay yeah sorry uh so what I was saying is whatever that uh would be\n16:24\nhelpful to gimal Labs uh indirectly uh it should be considered that I think uh\n16:29\nScott mentioned um on uh the rational sorry I don't know um on what he thinks\n16:37\nis going to be helpful to gims in um um this um when um there's a decision\n16:45\non um the decrease of Treasury tax uh which is indirectly helping gimal laabs\n16:52\nin you know in the funding process so yes I think we should move on with that\n16:59\nokay okay yeah um paraa and then\n17:05\nMartin uh I I feel like I have enough information not that I can make a Deion\n17:11\nbut I think I have enough information and also I understand that gimal ABS currently depends on Catalyst but I\n17:18\npersonally I don't want the status quo to continue uh I really hope like we can be self- sustainable and not depend on\n17:25\nexternal organizations yeah a good point that's a good point um Martin and then\n17:32\nMonique I'm uh listening with a half ear so okay all right listening nice uh\n17:40\nMo'Nique and then Nelson so I honestly I'm catching up to\n17:46\nspeed a little bit I I I think I understand what's happening here and our\n17:51\nparticular position being funded by cadas but um I think that so the overall\n17:57\nlike purpose or or goal of of of this proposal um it was it's to increase hold\n18:06\non this is uh is to it's justified by uh increased staking uh returns and um\n18:14\npromoting decentralization I and I think that's like that's supposed to be the the\n18:20\nbenefit correct am I getting that right okay yeah okay yeah okay so I I I I\n18:26\nunderstand and um I have enough information I am perfect yeah perfect\n18:32\nthank you um Nelson and then\n18:37\nScott um yeah I also have enough information to understand proposal um\n18:43\nyeah and I have an opinion about it okay okay cool cool um let's go to Scott\n18:51\nScott I definitely know just to hear your voice though buddy yeah I've got enough information I just I do want to\n18:57\nlet everybody know that I'm not trying to sway a decision either of the way for gimal abbs um and I don't know if my\n19:03\napproach to this proposal was correct because I've never written a proposal for gimbal ABS so um anyway that's that\n19:09\nbut yeah I have enough information thank you excellent yeah and I do want to I do want to highlight that uh as I see James\n19:16\nwith the hand clapping this um you know we're not you know the consent a consent\n19:22\nprocess like this is making like a a civil container um I do want to recognize that Scott took the initiative\n19:29\nto sort of take on this with some with some you know uh uh um it was difficult\n19:36\nhe expressed how difficult it was because there's sort of conflict of interest and he's very uh fastidious or\n19:43\nvery uh like he he takes it very seriously this this sort of conflict of\n19:49\ninterest and and trying to be a representative uh and he does this more just to get the ball rolling and\n19:57\nlikewise I want to um acknowledge Adrien who was able to give like a good\n20:02\nCounterpoint like we have this phrase about getting to the no and that a no or\n20:08\nan objection is really a gift because that gives us the the space to sort of work these things out um so we're not\n20:15\ntrying to say this is right or this is wrong we're just trying to go through a process to sort of ascertain the thing\n20:21\nokay okay um uh Sebastian and then\n20:27\nSimon yeah I having information perfect so you got it the\n20:32\nbest um\n20:40\nSimon got oh yeah that's right he's already done um okay so I know that I\n20:46\nknow that Scott has to like he has to like be closing the door at uh 11 of his\n20:51\nhouse so um God do um I guess we can asked I one\n21:01\none of the unfortunate things about this is that the the window to vote is uh is\n21:06\ncoming up uh quickly um we I do W to I I do want to even\n21:16\nthough you may not be able to stay um I do want to get Adrian and\n21:25\nNelson um and Adrian you've kind of given your sort of your your uh uh your\n21:30\nobjection meaning and I think it was clearly stated that uh that look gimbal\n21:35\nLabs depends on catalist funds funds from that that tax uh is from there so\n21:42\nuh is that sum up the the argument that's one of\n21:49\nmys uh I would have some more but I don't think we have time for that yeah I\n21:55\nknow it's so it's so bad to uh so so Scott before you have to leave and I I\n22:00\njust want to do you want to um Le let's let's get your voice in here uh before\n22:06\nyou have to go on which\n22:13\nside um let's uh yeah what do you think about that and I know that this you know\n22:20\nbecause you know you don't you have a strong opinion for yourself but as gimble Labs uh you know I think it's\n22:26\nreasonable that that that tax comes from do you have anything that that sort of\n22:32\nhelps us understand better that are we seeing that clearly uh that you know that we're really funded by this tax and\n22:38\nthat you know that a vote on no to to keep the tax as it is is is probably\n22:43\nbest for for gimal labs yeah on that I don't know if it's best like I I don't know gimal Labs um\n22:52\nthey're budget where their funds come from or the economy of the uh Stak pool that is operated so\n22:59\nuh but if if indeed if indeed the the treasury is paying for the uh proposals\n23:04\nthat are funded um that I can see the impact on that if they were to decrease\n23:09\nthat um but gimal ABS also isn't the only entity or organization that is also\n23:15\nreceiving funding from the treasury so by and I'm playing Devil's Advocate so\n23:20\nby PL by by voting no because gimal lab's funding gets there is from there\n23:27\nyou're also pretty much giving a pass to every other project that's getting funding whether or not they're efficient\n23:33\nuseful or of the same so\n23:38\nand I as far as gimal abbs goes like I said I I will abstain anyway since I'm a d and I've already placed my vote and\n23:45\njust trying to play Devil's Advocate with the uh justification just mention yep all right and and Sebastian has his\n23:54\nhad his hand up I missed it twice sorry about that Sebastian no no no I prefer to to to\n24:00\nstate something about this this thing of\n24:06\ngimbals has catalyst is the only option to F gimal UPS in when I present my\n24:13\nproposal because I want I have a proposal to present today if we have the\n24:19\ntime but in general term in general terms I I think um it's a fact today but\n24:25\nuh for in that sense we have to move the organization or the this this exercise\n24:33\nto to another scenarios okay yeah thanks yeah I I definitely I definitely\n24:41\nagree um uh that yeah and then uh Simon I see that your hands up yeah I think\n24:49\nthere's\n24:54\num oh you you muted uh sorry yeah I just sat down the\n25:00\ncomputer and unmuted myself on the computer so I heard myself twice um yeah so I just wanted to make one more point\n25:06\nabout it which is I think it's an unfortunate timing to have it right now because everything with the budget is\n25:12\ncoming up I think it would have been better to have raised the question after the budget has gone through or yeah\n25:20\nmaybe before all the the budget craziness yeah I I think I I couldn't\n25:27\nvote any other way other than than no in this case but I can see like maybe in\n25:33\nthe future if it happen if it comes up again I could see myself vote Yes\n25:39\nactually interesting yeah yeah that is interesting and I'm gonna say goodbye to Scott and thank you so much for bringing\n25:46\nthis up and really taking the lead with h the the D role here Scott um it's really really been\n25:52\nincredible um okay uh so Andrew yeah Andrew we haven't heard from you\n25:59\nyou yeah sorry about that I think it was going to be my turn the internet dropped out I was really frustrating um so if\n26:07\nwe're still talking about this vote I'm inclined to go no um my reason is is uh\n26:14\non the face of it that sounds good to be as a Staker that you may get some extra rewards but there's a couple of things\n26:21\nuh I think James last week mentioned made a very good point about it's pretty disingenuous to label it as a t\n26:29\nbecause yeah the money stays in the ecosystem when when that money um gets\n26:35\npaid out to spos we don't know where that goes where that a goes that's fair enough that's\n26:40\nyou know their reward keep propping up the ecosystem but the the AER from the\n26:48\nto stays in the treasury which we as a part of cardano get to choose where\n26:55\nit goes and that's kind of what a lot of this governance is going to be about so to call it attacked I think is is a bit wrong um and then the other thing I look\n27:01\nat is the proponents of this um proposal in the first place seem to be mostly\n27:07\nmultipool operators um I'm going to be careful with my words now I don't want to offend anyone but\n27:15\nuh multipool operators\n27:22\nwell I'm not as keen on the concept of it so um yeah as much as on face it it\n27:28\nwould seem good for me as a Staker to to to vote Yes I think it's all a bit disingenuous so I say no yeah okay um I\n27:40\nNelson Nelson I know that you had something and and we'll extend just a little bit but I definitely want to come\n27:45\nup and we we can make a make a motion or sort of propose and just say hey a yes\n27:51\nor a no and we can do it uh uh we can do it that way I think I feel like that\n27:58\nmight be okay at this at this point but I'll hear from Nels um yeah without talking about my\n28:05\nopinion I think this vote is not going through right because we're not meeting\n28:12\nthe Constitutional thresold for the uh yeah for the Constitutional committee so\n28:19\nI I'm not sure if we are spending good time here or not because I yeah uh we\n28:25\nneed um 67% thre for the vote to go through and three of\n28:32\nthem voted no and one of them voted abstain so I don't think this going\n28:37\nthrough yeah yes uh\n28:43\nSimon and thanks thanks Nelson that is a good point yeah I wanted to just make one\n28:49\nmore comment about the disingenuous thing because I agree totally agree with that when I read that I thought this was\n28:56\nnot not framed well and I think this goes also more importantly I think this goes\n29:02\nto towards the culture that we want to have do we want to have like a political class that frames things like that or do\n29:10\nwe want to have um like a genuine uh fact based discussion right on with the\n29:18\nterms that are that are actually accurate and that we that we should use\n29:24\nhere and TX is not the the name or the the the framing and the the wding that\n29:30\ncomes to mind when I when I think about this yeah I think that's uh I'm glad\n29:36\nthat you mentioned that I'm glad that this is something because when I read this I'm like wait a minute this is just this is um uh a campaign speeches and\n29:46\nand we need to really see we need to have better you know like and is that a\n29:51\nmy my question was is that something that we can do as a community to sort of\n29:56\ncall it out and then re reframe it to where we can really get a sense of what exactly it is\n30:04\num James I see your hands up and and to that point like and picking up from Nelson's question is this worth the time\n30:12\nthis may be an early example of a proposal that we are best\n30:18\nignoring right like voting no is to take it seriously in a certain way not voting\n30:25\nat all is a way of prag a atically recognizing that the threshold is not\n30:30\nbeing met anyway and it's a way of publicly declaring that this is a silly\n30:37\nproposal framed in a particular terms that really don't\n30:43\napply um and so yeah I you know I think it's good to have an active goal of being sure to vote on everything while\n30:51\nalso recognizing that maybe not voting will sometimes be an action in itself\n31:00\nyes so so we've got options yes no abstain and ignore ignore ignore seems\n31:08\ncoming to the surface as a possibility right here right right I in the go ahead\n31:18\njust um what what what happens if\n31:26\num if everyone one ignores it but like a few people is there a threshold\n31:33\nthat needs to be met well you can see right here the the\n31:38\nconstitutionality threshold already won't to be met yeah whether we agree with that or\n31:45\nnot this is a system that works in a certain way and the way the system has\n31:50\nalready resolved this question is that three of seven on the Constitutional\n31:57\ncommittee have already registered a motion that this is\n32:03\nunconstitutional right and so therefore just as pragmatic rational actors in\n32:09\nthis ecosystem how much time do we want to give to this otherwise ridiculous\n32:14\nproposal and we all right all right right and we can go we can be we can\n32:20\nmake a public statement we can post this video wherever we want to right so\n32:26\nthat's an option right and so it's not always going to be passive to not vote it's possible to not vote and say look\n32:34\nwe gave this the time it's worth it's really not worth the time right now I agree with Simon that there's a point in\n32:40\nthe future where a yes vote might make a ton of sense um but right now it's it's\n32:46\na distraction that pulls in a political discourse that only exists in some but\n32:52\nnot all countries and and some people who live in one of those countries countes brought their problems to the\n32:59\ntable and framed it this way right like how much so how much time do we want to give those guys how much do we want to\n33:05\nfacilitate that kind of discourse and I'm glad people already named that here right we don't we can choose as a norm\n33:12\nnot to engage in that way yeah yeah right I was asking more from a d\n33:19\nperspective is there you can also you can see that current result as well and\n33:26\nso what's what's the number of no votes from DS already um yeah no I'm asking is there a\n33:32\nthreshold like if there's only I don't know 5% voting yes and everyone else abstains is gonna go through Yeah well\n33:40\nyeah and and if you saw that happening you would spring into action and you would register a vote but that's not the\n33:47\ncase right now yeah right right okay so with that in mind I think we're ready to\n33:54\nbecause uh you're right and we do have very important business so I and\n34:01\nHarsha what do you think um I think I'm I'm ready to uh uh just to to take a\n34:08\nround and and um propose ignore from the from the gimal grabs gimal Labs\n34:16\nD I'm cool with that yeah okay so this will have a uh let's\n34:25\nhave like a a voting round uh uh do you have an objection to um\n34:32\nignore and I'll go down the line um I I have no objection to uh and uh to to\n34:39\nignore James and then Adrien no\n34:45\nobjections uh Adrian No Object objections let's save the transaction\n34:51\nfee beautiful uh Andrew and then Emanuel yeah no OB from\n34:58\nme Emanuel then Hara yeah I have no\n35:05\nobjection yeah same no objection Martin then\n35:12\nmix he's just Martin just might be listening in I uh I agree yeah mix and mo hey guys\n35:23\nuh yeah I have no objection and I guess uh it would be a good opportunity for\n35:29\nthem to do better yeah yeah yeah yeah for those reasons that we mentioned earlier I definitely I definitely think\n35:35\nokay uh Monique and then Nelson no objection okay perfect thank\n35:41\nyou Nelson then Sebastian yeah I have no objection nice\n35:46\nnice Sebastian then Simon no\n35:54\nobjection S no look at that now we celebrate thank you thank you\n36:00\nvery much for working through that I feel like I feel like that was the process working I'm going to I'm I'm\n36:06\ntapping the uh the celebrate button um thank you so\n36:11\nmuch all right so you know I I think I think\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Which Spaces\n36:18\nthat's beautiful because there's other projects to be done here let's get into which spaces and you know I'd invite you\n36:26\nto sort of move around you know uh shift gears over into um this uh this other uh\n36:35\nCommunity uh uh proposal James is the owner and Source um this as you know is\n36:42\nthe catalyst is our Catalyst funding we have these um this is an\n36:50\ninflow of uh uh of uh of\n36:55\nmonies and that doesn't have our flow in here well the Catalyst fun 13 proposal\n37:01\nwould provide the inflow and this will back outflow from it okay um James do\n37:09\nyou want to uhh take the helm and uh guide us through this I can uh I I'm sharing the screen so I can point us in\n37:15\nthe right direction yeah thanks and so this proposal is pretty well along um we I think we talked about kind\n37:24\nof the driver and and those details and people have a chance to look at it and I'll drop it in the chat right now just\n37:29\nin case people need to read through here is the public\n37:39\nlink um but yeah so the goal here is to um keep public spaces at gimal Labs\n37:48\ngoing um the sort of spaces for example that are gutted when people in power\n37:54\ndecide to give everybody else a tax break and uh privatize public services\n38:00\nbut we'll we'll leave that aside for now um we are in the business of keeping\n38:05\npublic spaces open that's what we do at gimal laabs and what we want to do is\n38:11\nalso be supporting facilitators to get better and better at their craft and the\n38:17\nway we do that is by making sure that we're using some of our budget to fund\n38:22\npeople for facilitating meetings and we have the beginnings of a of a network of people who are\n38:29\npracticing this so for example Harsha and Newman have taken on facilitation of\n38:35\nthis space a few times this year and when when I have the privilege of\n38:41\nhanding it off to them I get to be a participant again which is a role I\n38:46\nreally enjoy playing um and I get to learn a lot um because being a\n38:52\nfacilitator you see everything through a different lens you're on a different Newman you can probably relate to this from today you're on a different kind of\n38:58\nalert that prevents you from thinking through all the ideas clearly because you are serving the rest of the\n39:03\ncommunity and that's a really big deal and so to share this across our growing\n39:10\necosystem and to make sure we're placing value in it that's what this proposal does right it takes the spaces we that\n39:18\nhave emerged at gimal Labs that have evolved to their current state which you can see down below number seven there's\n39:25\na table that name the spaces that we keep going over a closed time frame this\n39:33\nproposal is only about the first half of 2025 running spaces through May and then\n39:43\nactually another thing this proposal kind of um gives us the option to do is\n39:49\nto take some time off after may I do think that some seasons of not having\n39:56\nmeetings but doing maybe deep work or hackathons together is something I would really like to explore maybe in June and\n40:04\nso that's why I I I'm not making any proposal about that formally right now\n40:10\num but at least this proposal ends in May so that we can set the stage to have\n40:15\nsome options for using time differently maybe during some months or seasons of the year um so what you can see in that\n40:22\ntable right we're going to keep running aen live coding on Tuesdays this proposal require re Ires no funding for\n40:28\nthat because that's a separately funded project cardano all things go we just\n40:34\nstarted mix uh facilitated the third session of that yesterday and it's\n40:40\nreally starting to have a flow and a voice I think that that that session got really good reviews from people as we\n40:47\nwere leaving there's this Open Spaces session um speaks for itself this is\n40:55\nwhat we do um and then following this session uh the we just added a gimal ABS\n41:01\nTech standup which kind of toes the line between what what later sessions of\n41:08\nplutus pbl live coding have done in the past right giving anybody a chance to show up bring questions or demos work on\n41:15\nstuff together um and it's a step towards um moving us into a season at\n41:23\ngimal ABS where we are building stuff more often and this is already happening so the esteria work is really running on\n41:31\nits own driven by the people working on that project the plutus pbl maintainers\n41:38\nwork has really stood for itself and as as this continues and\n41:44\nlater if we have time I have a request for proposals for a technical project\n41:49\nthat I would like to just bring to the group and and see if anybody wants to pick it up but as this continues to\n41:56\nhappen and we do have these you know in S3 we would call them circles right\n42:01\nself-organizing circles um something like a weekly standup where people can get together\n42:07\nshow off and ask each other questions I think becomes a really engaging thing and that's why we're trying that\n42:12\nexperiment so with this calendar right here down below you can see an estimate\n42:17\nof how many sessions would run Open Spaces I'd like to make this retroactive to\n42:23\nJanuary um and so this would be funding for January through May total of 18 sessions it says about 18 just because\n42:31\nit might be if if we cancel a few more of them for any number of reasons that would be like the most um all things go\n42:37\nwould max out at 11 sessions Tech standup would max out at 11 sessions so you can see we have about 40 sessions at\n42:46\na proposed rate of 200 Ada for facilitating each one and that's why\n42:52\nthis proposal is asking for 8,000 Ada from the gimal ABS treasury to facilitate these sessions plus a\n43:00\nthousand for just Catalyst reporting itself which is critical this helps people know what we've been doing and\n43:06\nand invites other people into the work a thousand I think it is good to put this\n43:12\naside just for continued R&D about how we report on these things right there's\n43:17\nthe Catalyst reporting that we have to do but how about a th Ada for just\n43:24\nexperimenting with the ways we tell the stories about these spaces to whatever\n43:31\nstakeholders we don't have to decide exactly how to use it but I think this is really good for anybody who wants to\n43:37\npick up kind of that storytelling piece um and then keeping the calendar up to date I can continue to take care of that\n43:44\njust as part of this and then when I brought this proposal last week it did\n43:49\nopen a really good conversation about marketing but just to keep things easy to manage from a proposal perspective I\n43:56\nse seated those notes into a new Doc so we don't have to make marketing the\n44:01\nscope of this proposal just to keep facilitation going uh but I think we\n44:07\nshould flesh out a marketing plan for anybody who's interested in it so those\n44:12\nare the most important updates I just copied the same table if if you're not familiar with linked or synced blocks in\n44:20\nnotion this is a really helpful way you can edit in one place um and it stays the same in the other so this is just a\n44:26\ncop um of the same table that's above so you can read it again when it comes to responsibilities right we just want to\n44:32\nhave facilitators for all of these sessions I think it's okay if there aren't names on them yet like so Tech\n44:39\nstandup you can see in April and May there's nobody assigned to that yet um\n44:45\nthe reason I'm fine keeping it blank is I'm happy to do it but I won't fill in\n44:50\nmy name until giving somebody else the chance to take it on um and Newman Hara\n44:56\nif you guys become the default for Open Spaces but other people have the option\n45:01\nof jumping in how would you feel about that I wouldn't mind that necessarily um\n45:08\nwe definitely are going to do uh next week and uh the week after that will be\n45:14\nthe uh but yeah we wouldn't I don't yeah we'll have to talk it with with over with ARA but yeah that could that could\n45:20\nwork and I like that having um we could say this is the default host um because\n45:27\none of the nice things about a giant Community is that you know things happen and and it's good to have people to fill\n45:32\nin and those Fillin spots can lead into the more default post so\n45:38\nyeah cool thank you yeah that's exactly how I'm thinking of it and it it echoes to what Scott said about writing the\n45:46\nprevious proposal we were talking about the DP vote like somebody has to do that first step right but but he made it\n45:53\nclear he didn't want to be seen as wanting to express a strong opinion he was trying to get a conversation started\n46:00\nand in a similar way a default host is there as a service not because they're\n46:06\ntrying to grab a rooll and keep it from anybody else but because it's good to know like okay if nobody else steps up\n46:12\nhere's who's going to do this but we can keep practicing offering the option to\n46:18\nother people and and eventually people do step up yeah y I think that that's and that that terminology I think is\n46:24\nreally great so responsibilities that's why these responsibilities aren't fully fleshed\n46:31\nout but I hope that makes sense to folks that they they are fleshed out but they're left open to keep that door open\n46:39\num and yeah potential risks I think it's worth it just to name right we're uncertain about the impact of these\n46:46\nspaces and some of it is you know some of it you could compare to planting a tree and and you're not going to see its\n46:51\nfruit for a long time obviously that's that's a nice story we can tell ourselves if we're not sure about our\n46:57\nimpact um but we we we maybe want to start looking for ways to decide whether\n47:04\nthese spaces are are delivering value and that's a really hard thing to do um and\n47:12\nso that's why it's good just to list some risks and mitigations just to say look we have questions we're we're we\n47:17\ndon't know the long-term import of this um but at least by reminding each other\n47:24\nof that we can stay open and and dedicated to like asking those questions so yeah I think that's I think\n47:31\nthis is pretty complete um and yeah I can pass it off to Newman to facilitate the process yeah so now the first thing\n47:39\nand if you recall our process the first round that we do is to and we can\n47:45\npopcorn style this it's like do you have questions that clarify not an opinion\n47:51\nwhether this should be funded or not necessarily at this stage but just uh there's something that uh we call it\n47:57\nclarifying questions and it's if you have in you have an informational\n48:03\nrequest of James the owner or the community at large uh harsh do that does\n48:10\nthat match where we're at in the process now sounds good yes yes\n48:16\nokay so and we'll do this popcorn style so if you have uh a clarifying question\n48:22\nuh just uh you can just jump off mute and and uh and speak or put it in the\n48:28\nchat arsha will mind the\n48:33\nchat okay so people feel we've done this we\n48:39\ndid we've done this process once before so we we we did this or they fund\n48:46\n12 um uh uh project Catalyst uh uh sustain\n48:53\nand maintain gimbal Labs proposal so it's should be pretty familiar\n48:58\neverybody's being quiet I'm feeling like it's pretty\n49:04\nestablished I do have I have a question and that is\n49:11\nprerequisites so is this a prerequisite for the\n49:17\nfacilitator James yes I forgot that I even added that here so yeah the idea\n49:22\nhere is um we are in we're moving all of these projects one by one into\n49:30\nandamio and so we could play with this concept like what what would somebody\n49:36\nhave had to do first before they could join as a facilitator for one of these\n49:44\nspaces right um and I don't think we have to fully answer that question now\n49:50\num it'll be an exciting moment if somebody we've never met before shows up\n49:56\nand says hey can I facilitate next week um I think we can save that question for\n50:01\nwhen it happens right for now anybody who's expressed interest in\n50:07\nfacilitation is at least known to others because they've showed up for a certain number of meetings so far um and so I\n50:13\nthink we can leave it like that and then on the technical side we've talked about this in the dev space the last few weeks\n50:19\nand this will be a continued thing um where we talk about like what are the prcts to joining any project that's\n50:27\napproved here but I don't think it has to be the scope of this proposal right right um yeah the for\n50:35\ninstance you wouldn't want somebody that doesn't have uh Tech and development\n50:40\nexperience you know hosting the the the tech standup meaning that the real value\n50:46\nin that is having an experienced person there to sort of guide uh I always like to think of them as uh computer lab\n50:54\nattendance like those guys knew so much stuff and if you just be friends with them order a pizza you're in you're\n51:03\nin uh you know one of the things about this facilitation that we're doing is uh\n51:08\nthe facilitators collective uh actually has a course and it's something that I've completed um okay any other\n51:17\nquestions um I can show\n51:23\nthe oh wait oh it's up at the top there is a budget workshop and so one of the\n51:28\nthings about when you read these you know you can really you can really go\n51:33\ndown and ask like go to the requirements and what it's asking um and and the\n51:40\nbudget is a big one um so in that vein I created this\n51:45\nspreadsheet and it is [Music]\n51:52\nhere and is the total budget well anyway this you know we can but so\n52:01\nwe're going to we're offloading the marketing and so this gets down to\n52:08\nzero um and so we're gonna this is a $10,000 um a 10,000 Ada um\n52:16\nrequest right okay\n52:22\nokay yeah I feel uh let's H let's Okay Bon\n52:31\nyeah respect to the pr Rex I think we can we can lower the the\n52:38\nbarrier asking for H taking the specific model the facilit the new facilitator\n52:44\nwant to want to facilitate right because it's really complicated to to push the\n52:51\npeople to take the whole L to gain that spot facility in\n52:57\nthings um we can okay maybe you want to I don't know you but the thing is I\n53:04\ndon't know you but you can you can participate so at least take the model that you want to\n53:10\nfacilitate and it's let's see from that right\n53:16\nright yeah yeah\n53:23\nexcellent paraa I think that our next our next process is are we to\n53:33\nOB objections and concerns yeah oh yeah uh does anyone have um concerns or\n53:42\nwant to frame the discussion here uh James is the owner and I'll and\n53:50\nI'll go down the line here Adrian and Andrew any\n53:57\nuh like a concern it's like anything that pops up sounds good\n54:03\nto me okay excellent thank you Andrew anything that's popping popping up to you that you want to\n54:09\nverbalize uh no no um I think this is a fair proposal and uh yeah shout out to\n54:16\neveryone who contributes around here and um you get uh yeah it's great place to\n54:22\nbe around nice um Emanual and then\n54:28\nHara concerns and objections no I have no objection to\n54:36\nthis uh because I was about to ask if this is the first time this is coming up\n54:42\nuh and uh I think said it was I think I\n54:47\nthink he said it was done in the last uh yeah it was done in the last F round so\n54:53\nyes uh so this is the way to about it yes no objection perfect perfect um harsh and\n55:02\nthen manual yeah uh no objections yeah uh Martin and then next thanks thanks uh\n55:10\nMara uh no objections cool mix and then Monique yep\n55:16\nno objection either okay cool Monique no\n55:22\nobjections thanks Nelson and then Sebastian no\n55:31\nOB no objections okay Simon so Simon asked\n55:37\nthat he had stepped away so this basically is our object objection round and it and it's where you know if you\n55:44\nhave any strong opinion um about whether we ex we adopt this proposal um uh this\n55:51\nis where you would would voice it it can also be a concern it's just like oh well maybe the this part needs to be uh\n56:00\nchanged yeah it's okay I don't I don't want to waste anyone's time on this we\n56:05\ngot all right all right I love it um yeah I think that we can um adopt this\n56:14\nproposal and I uh this proposal is adopted no objections all around hey\n56:20\ncelebration time I definitely want to get a screen something that celebrates\n56:26\nhere you know what I mean the T icon can only take you so far it's really it's it it\n56:32\nused to be so cool you know but now um and we can um oh oh wait a minute wait a\n56:39\nminute this is a little more so where we\n56:45\ngo here and we move this is it we move it right now\n56:53\nthis is satisfying wa wait don't we oh no we can do it here status\n57:00\nthis one two in progress and it goes down\n57:11\nhere right this one okay progress\n57:18\nhooray okay now so we're shifting gears again um oh we're going to move this\n57:26\nwant to backlog this one goes backlog done I I\n57:31\nthought it was it was we yeah we go to done yeah we go to\n57:37\ndone okay hooray all right that's our celebrate thing can we drag it you can\nA quick check, Proposal: Gimbalabs Marketing Plan.\n57:44\ncan we go like this you can okay I don't want to try it live on TV I think the uh the destination has to be open but yeah\n57:50\nit should work oh okay cool um now this one draft of the gimbal Labs marketing\n57:58\nplan now this one I don't think there's been progress on this one since last week I didn't\n58:04\nhave time to Fork it until today um okay but yeah we can Seb do you want to pick\n58:10\nup the marketing one now or should we save that one in the planning or\n58:18\nbacklog yeah I think I I think this guy and Shaggy Shaggy one wants to be in the\n58:27\nThe Proposal that I don't know we can we can ping him with a link to this yeah\n58:34\nyeah okay is he in\n58:40\nthe is he is oh not yet not yet he's not in\n58:47\nokay um but just taking a brief look at this one uh this one is the gimbal ABS marketing\n58:55\nplan and remember we took out some budget from the witch spaces into the marketing which I think makes a lot of\n59:00\nsense um so uh there is a lot that goes into marketing and I know Simon you has\n59:07\nhand up go ahead Simon yeah so I've been thinking about\n59:13\nuh about working on this for chimber labs with a friend of\n59:18\nmine um yeah but I'm not best friends with shagy so\n59:25\nI'm not sure if that is a good option anymore to be honest you don't\n59:31\nnecessarily only have to work with best friends you can work with everyone example I was gonna give I was\n59:38\ngonna tell har a bad joke I always joke around with har but do you have a a is there you guys are do well\n59:48\nyeah I I think yeah I I tried not not to get\n59:53\ninvolved with him I I think yeah I've been working with him on the uh\n59:58\nmarketing working group in intersect and it didn't it only hurt me I don't want\n1:00:04\nto be involved with him anymore yeah yeah however that's all I'm gonna say in this case I think we\n1:00:11\ncan you can prepare a proposal in the same way in the same area right in the same with the same topic and as\n1:00:18\nCommunity you can decide okay this this proposal has more sense to it's more aligned with the primary R of gimbal\n1:00:25\nabsur or shag's proposal or something like that this is a good this I think this is a good situation because we have\n1:00:32\nseveral people interested on on participating the marketing site but\n1:00:38\nwith a different different approach right that's valid so I invite you to to\n1:00:44\ntake the present a proposal so if if I were to do that I would need some um\n1:00:50\ninformation about the goals and the general strategy of chimol labs where\n1:00:55\ncan of I can I can help you I can have you har I don't know you can also I can\n1:01:00\nmake some notes right we can open a document a public document in in Ocean\n1:01:06\nand start adding adding some points there for everybody that wants to to be\n1:01:12\na proposal around marketing all right okay so I get I get in contact with you Sebastian and um you can refer me to the\n1:01:19\nnecessary information yeah I will open the I will open the document and I ping\n1:01:26\nyou when when this is ready and also I will ping to to\n1:01:32\nshaggi to when the document is ready right and everyone of you can can offer\n1:01:38\nthe do this their thing I don't know if if any of you guys\n1:01:44\nhave of girls have some some objection in the approach I think it's the most\n1:01:50\nmost the most fair for everybody yeah and now so this is draft\n1:01:56\nlike a marketing plan which I know that Simon has like a good amount of experience on based on his work with\n1:02:02\nintersect and some other things um but it also is fulfilling the responsibility\n1:02:08\nfor things that we've got written down here uh bringing people to the session\n1:02:13\num that that the that there's life and action on the social networks that we\n1:02:19\nhave a consistent open and live gimbal lab spaces um establishing workflows\n1:02:26\nlike a set of tasks and and times to do things as far as our promotion uh\n1:02:31\nannouncements in web hooks like calendaring um you know we talked about\n1:02:38\nsort of the automated tools um Twitter spaces uh just representing uh gimbal\n1:02:44\nlabs in the in the market uh uh reporting and tracking metrics so what I\n1:02:50\nsee is that there's actually a big ecosystem uh you know a department so uh\n1:02:56\nand it's in a decentralized way meaning that you know if you were to you know\n1:03:01\nthere may be something that you can do even you don't have to work really uh so closely with others um for instance this\n1:03:09\nMedia Kit maintenance the that feels like it's a a periodic thing uh as\n1:03:16\nopposed to um like a operational uh weekly maintenance of\n1:03:22\nmaking announcements which is basically what Sebastian does now um but uh yeah yeah yeah yeah I I\n1:03:29\ndefinitely think there's a place for uh opport there are opportunities here\n1:03:37\num so Sebastian or Simon is your hands still up\n1:03:45\nor yeah uh what are the next actions here you know this it feels like we need\n1:03:52\nmore um more work to make it more\n1:03:57\ndefined is that is that a in fact in fact I don't have to we\n1:04:04\ndon't have to open a new document we can we can use this to add some notes at the\n1:04:09\nend of the at the end of the of the do okay\n1:04:15\nyeah yeah so we'll keep this one we'll keep this one in uh\n1:04:22\nconsent and uh uh could we in the 20 10 10 to 15 minutes we've got\n1:04:30\nleft uh which of these would be good to attack\nComunity Review + Consent, Proposal: Gimbalabs Incubator and Accelerator. Phase 1: Front End Support.\n1:04:36\nnext i' like to share something about the galap in Creator that's a proposal\n1:04:42\nthat I want to to present today excellent that is that is yeah go\n1:04:48\nahead yeah let's do it okay this proposal is aligned with um what we are\n1:04:54\ndiscussing just a few moments about the the only\n1:05:00\nthe finance the funding sources of gimbals this is a a think an idea that I\n1:05:05\nhave had and I I I'm sure that I I was not the only one trying to\n1:05:14\nto to identify some another sources funding sources for for game Bops right\n1:05:22\nand this is this proposal is based on conversations that I I had the\n1:05:28\nopportunity to to have with ex students and ex dep students in in that took some\n1:05:38\nuh some some classes and lessons in the in\n1:05:43\nthe spaces in the gal spaces and their level of satisfaction H\n1:05:50\nER takes them to think that H seriously on make some donations to to galops in\n1:05:59\nexchange of the the pro the the activities educational activities we make here so and today we have we are in\n1:06:07\nthis ecosystem where the incubation and acceleration is taking a really good a really good first\n1:06:14\nstage and this is I think I think this is This falls into the the expertise of\n1:06:22\ngimbal UPS as Community organization so the thing is um building\n1:06:30\nincubator is a really big exercise it's a complex cace like that and in in that\n1:06:37\nsense we can H start for step by step um\n1:06:43\nidentifying um urgent Necessities in the ecosystem in the developer ecosystem and\n1:06:49\nstart to support some in in some way those kind of Necessities one of the the\n1:06:55\nthe most clearness needs in the uh needs\n1:07:00\nis the the frontend front end development the the the projects and startups in the ecosystem needs urgently\n1:07:08\nsome kind of support in the front side right and they have the budget they have the budget to to to support\n1:07:14\nto to to fund those kind of some kind of\n1:07:20\num um assistance and support in that way right but we have zero\n1:07:26\nH dep force in in in that front in that layer of the developer stack so my idea\n1:07:34\nwith this proposal is to um um start building this idea of uh\n1:07:41\nmaking galops an incubator and an accelerator\n1:07:46\num based on and and the first step the first step is to build a a a collective\n1:07:53\nI I call that in this in this in this proposal Collective Collective of frontend developers not expert\n1:08:00\ndevelopers just gimbal apps members that have some kind of a experience some kind\n1:08:07\nof a domain in the area of front end development sufficient to support a a\n1:08:15\ncardano projects right and we know cardano projects are really not too complex projects in some\n1:08:23\nway they they are complex in the back end but in the front end they are as as\n1:08:28\nusual as the web to web to U projects um so my proposal is first\n1:08:35\nstart taking a steps into build that kind of circle that would be would be a new Circle um a basic Circle a basic\n1:08:43\nsale of developers from developers gimbal UPS members that can provide some\n1:08:49\nkind of support on that right I was thinking for example on Hara Hara has has has experience in ux development I\n1:08:58\nwas thinking on Newman that has some kind of I don't know I'm I'm just I can\n1:09:03\nhave a a rudimentary knowledge about you guys about your experience but I think you have some kind of exper expertise on\n1:09:12\nwhat is around uh front end development around ux experience and all that stuff\n1:09:19\nand I think we can use that and and and on only talking about just\n1:09:26\nboth of you guys but this this is an invitation to everybody that has some\n1:09:31\nkind of expertise in front of development basic no matter the the the\n1:09:39\nlevel yeah an invitation uh so that's the first start building the the circle the circle the\n1:09:47\nfront and circle with this approach of a supporting front end ER supporting\n1:09:53\ncardano projects in the area of incubation right of incub of supporting supporting projects uh in the\n1:10:02\ndetails of the proposal I invite you to read The Proposal in these details you can see uh first is the calling of the\n1:10:10\nof the members interested in in in in in be part of the of the circle the second\n1:10:15\nis around this the the these first um sessions that allow to start clarifying\n1:10:22\nprocedures and uh driver mapping in general general terms and the thing we\n1:10:27\nhave a a a rabit test rabit know I'm saying that really well I proposed\n1:10:35\nandamio because andamio first is a I I I gave there the the the reasons why\n1:10:42\nandamio is a good Prospect to serve to this ex this first exercise as the the a\n1:10:50\nproject test that can can resist all our experiments around frontend development\n1:10:58\nsupport um in among those merits that I think are valuable first is was is a\n1:11:05\ncompany funded by many of the instructors and and and and teachers\n1:11:11\nthat voluntarily have provide services to galops for for\n1:11:17\nyears and I think it's that makes them a\n1:11:22\napt to receive some kind of support and currently andamio is supporting\n1:11:28\ngimbals in in in provide in providing the courses the several courses that we\n1:11:35\nare today h delivering to the students and the cardano ecosystem in general in\n1:11:41\nour Open Spaces I have to say I have to say this H this prop this this whole\n1:11:48\nproposal is align with the primary driver of the of gimbal because the primary driver talks about\n1:11:56\nbuilding spaces building new spaces right and we have in in in today we have\n1:12:03\ninternal and and and and really well known spaces but internally at kind\n1:12:11\nof a in our wellknown wellknown uh radar\n1:12:18\nbut I think we must to start testing the boundaries of these limits of our usual\n1:12:25\nradar and start to think on expanding our expanding our\n1:12:30\nour our area of action in terms of spaces I think we can go and start to\n1:12:36\nbuilding spaces outside of the of our traditional uh our traditional ER\n1:12:45\ntraditional field right and start to build in a kind of pipeline between our\n1:12:50\ninternal and well-known spaces and these spaces that are FOC fused on incubating\n1:12:56\nand supporting supporting projects we can build there a kind of pipeline that can communicate both intentions right\n1:13:04\nimagine for example a proposer or a a entrepreneur a cardan entrepreneur on an\n1:13:10\nN entrepreneur or a Solan entrepreneur etc etc that wants to start building on\n1:13:16\ncardano right he can come here to envelops and start taking the the the\n1:13:21\nour our sessions and then they can go to our our circles in charge of supporting\n1:13:30\nprojects in a specific areas in this case front end but with time depending of how this experiment goes we can start\n1:13:37\nsupporting projects in other areas in backing areas specific more more more\n1:13:43\nmore in technically intense areas so yeah that's right um I think we we\n1:13:51\nhave okay that's that general idea if we go to the scroll down the impact the\n1:13:58\nimpact talks about that uh we can start we can K starting our efforts\n1:14:05\nthrough a a gimbal UPS incubator right and as a gimbals incubator we can have\n1:14:12\naccess not only to the Catalyst funds but also to intersect funds but also to\n1:14:17\ndonations from the developers direct donations to gimbal apps from H the\n1:14:23\ndevelopers that receive support we can charge to those to those projects if\n1:14:30\nthey have the they have the they have received for example a catalis proposal or they have they have a catalis\n1:14:36\nproposal or an intersect proposal in course we can we can there in the scenario we have several ways of getting\n1:14:43\nfunds and getting income and from years we have had that g in gimbal apps this\n1:14:49\nidea of gimbal up Solutions where we provide H the project services in in\n1:14:55\ndifferent areas right this front endend Collective can be the first of the whole\n1:15:01\narray of services we can provide to the to the people\n1:15:06\nyes uh so I read through the through the proposal and I'm curious as to what is\n1:15:13\nthe connection between anio and I think they're providing 10,000 data right did\n1:15:19\nI get that right yeah we have a proposed as uh as you know in in the section uh resources\n1:15:27\nresources I'm asking 10,000 Adas for funding for for funding two deps for h\n1:15:35\ntwo months the ration okay so this is a proposal that goes to uh anio right no\n1:15:42\nthis is a proposal that goes to gimbal ABS I I'm asking for an funding funding\n1:15:47\nfrom gimbals no from galops to fund these two deps and these two deps will start to to work with d te what is the\n1:15:55\nrational behind that um I see the the the rational is\n1:16:03\nU galab andamio is a as many other\n1:16:08\nprojects in the ecosystem has some specific needs in the front end u in the\n1:16:14\nfront end side andamio and imelaps has a kind of relationship and they can provide in the\n1:16:21\nshort and in the medium term some kind of mutual service Services if gimbal apps has success in the in providing the\n1:16:30\nthe services to the companies that they have to to to to they have to provide\n1:16:38\nall that benefit will go to to to the collective Collective\n1:16:44\nrecognition right and so what is the um how does it combine with the with the\n1:16:54\nsorry is an accelerator the with the with the overall idea of building the\n1:16:59\nthe capacity of of um front end developers and\n1:17:05\necosystem yes the the main goal of this of this of this proposal is build is to\n1:17:10\nbuild our own capacity of provide services to other projects galops in\n1:17:16\nthis case andamio is one of the projects that that we have at hand in this moment and they I have to say I'm part of gamia\n1:17:24\nand many others here are part of and right so we are available to\n1:17:32\ncoordinate the activities necessary to provide the\n1:17:37\nexpertise ER H to the developers all the\n1:17:42\nthe the space that they need to exper the gimbal apps deps will need to\n1:17:48\nexperiment in in this clients or this incubation relationship\n1:17:58\nright so is the idea that the two developers um would would help with the\n1:18:08\nincubator or like I'm just trying to connect the resources that are going in there with\n1:18:14\nthe overall goal right like how how does it connect to the\n1:18:21\nincubator yeah um okay if you want you can put the\n1:18:28\nclarifying questions in the document and I can I can start to to to to answer those questions but in a nutshell uh in\n1:18:37\na nutshell this uh this funded developers from gimbal\n1:18:43\nABS that will work with andamio um will attend the andamio will\n1:18:49\nbe the first client of gimbals in this in this in this in this incubation\n1:18:57\nwork uh from that we will gather data about what's happening how how we go the\n1:19:02\nprocess how the process work work in and start to take some decisions about it uh\n1:19:10\nmy invitation is to just read the proposal the entire proposal and just\n1:19:16\nplease put the there the objections and questions you could have\n1:19:27\nyes and uh thank you yeah that's uh that's great Sebastian um and I will put in a little section for clarifying\n1:19:34\nquestions and then let's uh let's quickly do a round of uh this is sort of\n1:19:40\na response like it's not for objections or or but it's like clarifying questions\n1:19:46\nor uh just uh your feeling um let's we can make it short we do I do want to\n1:19:51\ngive us a few minutes to sign out or to check out um let's start up at the top of my list uh James and then we'll skip\n1:19:59\nover Sebastian and uh Andrew um yeah I'm excited to see how\n1:20:05\nthis proposal evolves and it reminds me of other things we've done in the past right trying a new pattern um to see\n1:20:12\nwhat products it might emerge so yeah I'm excited thanks Seb for writing\n1:20:17\nit Well Done uh Andrew and then Adrian uh yeah uh think that's an\n1:20:25\ninteresting proposal actually um yeah um sorry I've not really got\n1:20:30\nmuch else to say on it I'm just I'm interested uh yeah I like I like the sound of it yeah it all sounds positive\n1:20:36\nso we'll see how it goes and uh Adrian and then Emanuel\n1:20:44\nsounds like a really interesting proposal thanks\n1:20:49\nup and Emanuel then Hara\n1:20:54\nyeah uh it's it's a very great uh proposal yeah yeah uh it's uh we know\n1:21:00\nhow uh you know um on K development there's been a lot of backend Works\n1:21:07\ngoing on and I think this is uh this is uh a very interesting proposal and\n1:21:13\nobviously I was uh I've been uh so much interested uh but uh I tried front end\n1:21:20\nbut I think I'm feeling in front end uh pretty early bad so yes uh yes it's a\n1:21:25\nvery nice yes excellent thanks Manuel thanks I have I just want to say my intention in\n1:21:32\nthis session was just share the proposal I was not aspiring to okay get the the\n1:21:38\napproval today but the first step is to share my my my intentions here and\n1:21:44\nthat's it yeah uh yeah for sure for sure um but let's I I I'm loving this these\n1:21:50\nthese uh coming up with these questions um Harsha and then um\n1:21:55\nMar so uh I actually was speaking to Newman about this like my initial\n1:22:01\nthoughts are that the way we think about front end in the age of AI is going to\n1:22:07\nbe different I think Theory becomes extremely important so I think if we focus on Theory the rest of it can be\n1:22:15\nautomated that's just my opinion yeah\n1:22:20\nyeah um okay thank you Hara that's a great Point Martin and then\n1:22:26\nmix yeah do stuff great do stuff love\n1:22:34\nit and mix and then Nelson yeah I do agree with this\n1:22:39\nproposal actually the the idea of uh being incubator or supporting developers\n1:22:47\nor even creating a Marketplace for developers uh or you know being kind of\n1:22:53\njob shadowing something we talk throughout several years of running\n1:22:58\ngimbal ABS about all these ideas um so yeah let's try maybe this is a year that\n1:23:06\ngimal ABS uh will use its community so that the community will get\n1:23:14\nbenefits in different ways that we were doing in uh past so sure I completely\n1:23:23\nsupport uh proposal such proposal and also uh I can see that we have other\n1:23:30\nneeds in the ecosystem so sure it's a front end but smart contract developer\n1:23:35\nback end or even system design so there are peoples out there that uh they have\n1:23:41\nsome ideas but they cannot conceptualize that because they don't have the enough\n1:23:46\ntechnical uh ideas or I don't know technical capability to you know\n1:23:52\njust uh think that idea into this blockchain space or\n1:23:57\neven cardano I mean they have something in ethereum they don't have and actually\n1:24:02\nI've seen many proposal Catalyst proposal that they have lacking these people and they seek these people so\n1:24:10\nyeah I think this would be a great start for doing that uh\n1:24:16\nhopefully uh we we will see great uh and I don't know like great proposal as\n1:24:22\noffspring of these proposal perfect thank you mix and Simon uh we we\n1:24:30\njust have one minute left um I do know that we we kind of have a weird hard\n1:24:35\nstop because we go to the next uh Tech standup but I do want to close this one out so Simon maybe you want to mention\n1:24:42\nyour question real quick and then we'll and then we'll close it\n1:24:47\nout or we can we can yeah yeah just still a bit unclear about how to\n1:24:55\ndevelopers uh working on theam website will help build a front end\n1:25:02\nincubator but yeah yeah okay um and Sebastian let's uh if uh let's answer\n1:25:11\nthat question on the um on the notion and this will be like a little teaser um\n1:25:18\ntoh come back to this proposal and see uh how it's answered in the future\n1:25:23\nbecause we are at time um yeah right and I just want to say I I agree with like\n1:25:29\nwe do need froment developers I also see it in our team and I think like when I\n1:25:35\nwas at the at the convention I heard from I think two other teams actually they would need from developers so it is\n1:25:42\nyeah it is great to hear that you guys are doing something about that for sure for\n1:25:48\nsure cool um harsh uh uh\n1:25:54\nthanks Sebastian Harsha any uh any last words have we forgotten anything or are we ready to shut down no I I thought\nFinal words and closing.\n1:26:01\ntoday was like the most efficient Open Spaces we've went through like so much so that was great yeah it's all you man\n1:26:07\nit's all you it's all you you don't you have no paraa is like the duck he's the duck\n1:26:14\nfeet under the duck I'm the duck I'm the top of the duck paraa is the bottom of the duck I maybe I don't\n1:26:20\nknow there's just too many things that rhyme with duck\n1:26:26\nall right y'all um I am G to hang up my hat and we'll start in on the tech standup I don't do we go to we don't go\n1:26:32\nto a different one I think we just we take a little break generally uh you guys have been at it for a while now and\n1:26:39\nthen we'll start up stay right here do people should we take a 49 or 14 minute break any anybody feel\n1:26:48\nstrong way like the only even number is four so I'll pick four four minute break oh my\n1:26:54\ngod oh on a 9 minute break let start at 1210 10 after all right 10 after 10\n1:27:00\nafter yeah we'll pick it up

yes I can so you can okay Alex can see the screen\n3:03\nthere's some thumbs up all right so this is where we're at today uh\n3:12\nmonthly proposal updates so everything inside of the in\n3:19\nprogress we would like to review so this is our project board here at gimbal Labs\n3:25\num these are all the different phases that we can be in and we want to focus in on on in progress there are nine\n3:32\nprojects in progress and each of these and by the\n3:37\nmap magic of notion is its own little project with these little properties for\n3:44\ninstance um this one started August 1 uh of last year uh and is still going\n3:52\non um what can we say about this\n3:57\nSwan is so the fun 12 proposal is closed out and we the the funding is complete\n4:04\nso we have transferred everything to gimal ab's treasury I think we can move that to\n4:09\ncompleted oh so now I mean we're starting off with like a like a like a home run right off the bat uh uh are we\n4:17\nready to move this into complete I uh does anybody have any kind of uh objection to that is anybody like oh no\n4:24\nthere's something else going on in this proposal no then we can go into\n4:34\ndone oh my goodness that feels good look now there's only eight um all right all right moving on\n4:40\ndown the list um the aeria frontend T3 app framework with mesh so this is one\n4:47\nthat I'm working on oh oh Alex you got your hand\n4:52\nup oh yes because uh I came to CH on the proposal just the backlog stage and not\n4:59\nthe progress stage ah yeah if we could for sure let's go through them uh\n5:10\nafter these in progress um and definitely I want to get to those down\n5:16\nhere in the PA which which one are proposal or\n5:26\nback backl is in the end oh okay backlog yeah um let's go through\n5:32\nthose after we do the uh in progress it'll be pretty quick um but before we go into Community review and consent\n5:38\nbecause that will take us into our sort of normal normal meeting um all\n5:43\nright uh so this one I've um so I'm working on this one with Hara and Andrew\n5:51\nand Emmanuel as as well as James um this one's going well are there any anything\n5:59\nAndrew or or Harsha to update uh so update is that we are in\n6:06\nthe final stages of deploying our instance we are still working on deploying the pellets and we are hitting\n6:13\nlike one tiny road block uh and we'll be presenting that roadblock in the dev standup\n6:18\ntoday yeah Andrew that feels like a pretty good update I've been actually\n6:24\nworking I've been I've been having a lot of fun with this project I'm really stoked no yeah all good cool all\n6:33\nright um next one Community governance and maintenance the plutus pbl course um\n6:41\nJames and Hinson this one is the this is like the maintainers course is that right yeah\n6:48\nthat's right yeah I might as well sort of gave you a hint at that before I didn't forgot it was the last Thursday\n6:54\nthe month so we've just um we've just uh can't I think there was like 60\n7:01\nlessons or something like that to update and we we've at the stage where we've uh either completed or we have amended all\n7:08\nthe lessons they're just uh probably the final 20% are in the like QA\n7:14\nstage uh so we've gone really well um when we do get to the end I think we\n7:21\nwe'll need to come back to here um to Open Spaces to talk about budget because we're under budget but there's also a\n7:28\ncouple of things that were a bit out scope so it might be a case that some of the uh uh the budget money gets put to\n7:35\nsomething slightly different in it but anyway I don't speculate that too much we're going very well um there as you\n7:42\ncan see so yeah unfortunately I can't make this Conan board move over but that's just me\n7:48\nbeing a noob the reason why that is because you have to go all the way to the bottom and then all the way to the\n7:53\nright and then you'll see that the amount of green ones that are done or in release ah here we go here we go yeah\n7:59\nmight as well do it yeah if you go scroll back up oh you needed to go over\n8:05\none more actually oh gosh okay you can you can toggle over to tasks view as\n8:11\nwell if the can ban is oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we all those ones that\n8:17\nare done now so um it's been a a long project but a good\n8:24\none yeah this is a I I'm really stoked about this in I Lawrence leay I mean you\n8:31\nguys are awesome lawence think is is is one of a Hidden Gem in our\n8:37\ncommunity um okay but yeah it feels like things are going well there excellent so\n8:43\non to the\n8:50\nnext this this is one of our pbls that I\n8:56\ndon't know that much about Sebastian James how is it how it\n9:02\ncoming I can do it I can do it uh I'm going to share my screen really\n9:08\nquick oh oh yeah sure show you guys something uh see my screen how do I how\n9:16\ndo I let go okay here we go [Music] and okay yeah are you\n9:24\nsee I can't see it just I can't see it just no I can't\n9:31\nwhich ah here there it is okay sorry H\n9:36\nokay this is the andamio platform and here you can see the Marlo pbl instance\n9:43\nof this first this is this proposal is a self-funded proposal it's totally funded\n9:49\nby The Catalyst uh treasury so it's independent from the\n9:56\ngimbal apps funds but it's contributing to the richness and offering to the G to\n10:02\ngimbar Up's educational sources uh so if I go\n10:09\nhere you can see can you see in this moment uh a change in my\n10:16\nscreen it says total value locked uh 23,000\n10:22\nAdas okay this proposal is in the first stages of\n10:27\ndevelopment that means we are starting to to build the outline of the course\n10:34\nright um and from that point we will we will start to open the project\n10:42\nto set the the people that H can be interested on building h lessons and\n10:50\ncontributing to that outline In This Moment H the funds received by the by\n10:57\nCat by the by catalyst are in are in this are locked in this instance right\n11:03\nthis is a public instance so everybody can can go to this to this H instance\n11:10\nand check\n11:17\nwhat with the dist we are\n11:27\nthis I think this proposal will be open to to to the\n11:33\npublic to start building the lessons in a collaborative way\n11:39\nso uh also this propos this proposal will be active the whole year so it's\n11:46\nnot\n11:54\njust uh I'm I think we cut out\n11:59\nmight be having connection issues I thought it was me sorry my\n12:04\nconnection is terrible just to to end my my intervention uh this proposal very\n12:10\nsoon will be open to all the developers or non-developers that uh would like to\n12:15\nto contribute to build some lessons in a collaborative and open way H we have the\n12:21\nfunds there the funds are public so uh people people can can check not only the\n12:27\nthe funds the distribution of the funds but also how it's what is happening with the with the with the proposal and\n12:34\nparticipate in The Proposal uh this proposal will be open the whole year\n12:40\nbecause we are working with in in tandem with the what's what's doing the the\n12:46\nMarlo the Marlo core team so we depend of what's what's doing this this team\n12:53\nthis Maru team but for the moment I consider this proposal in progress\n12:58\nbeautiful at the rhythm of the of the proposal itself yeah uh that's that sounds really\n13:05\nexciting yeah thanks for that and the um uh especially the Ono parts that's\n13:11\nthat's gonna be really cool um okay Aken Aken\n13:16\nPBO um yeah quick update on that I was actually talking to Henson about this earlier today um we have one oh\n13:26\nsorry um we have one module uh left to publish and Hinson just built some code\n13:34\nexamples to go with it um and uh we're going to do the final new lecture the\n13:41\nsecond Tuesday from now I think it's April 8th at which time we will have finished this entire fund 12 Catalyst\n13:50\nproposal oh beautiful um forward-looking we're really excited to think about how\n13:55\nthis can serve as a prere to entering into other projects so as we start to talk about like gimal ab's treasury\n14:02\nmatching um and projects that maybe would follow the esteria work um aen pbl\n14:09\nI think serves as a really nice onboarding mechanism for for bringing new devs into the\n14:15\nwork yeah uh har I just just started taking we're\n14:21\nGNA speed run it or just yesterday we're like we're getting through\n14:27\nit open the live in uh but now we're like we need to redo it we get a refresh\n14:33\nand it's it's it it holds together it's a really good course and I encourage you anyone listening to my voice hop over to\n14:39\nandamio and check out the one of these beautiful pbls uh James that uh any final things\n14:50\nthat's yep okay heading on over to um uh sustain and maintain this might be you\n14:57\nHarsha yeah so for fund 13 the first Milestone has been accepted and we are\n15:03\nwaiting for the funds to come in the first Milestone and by the end of this\n15:09\nmonth which is probably uh tomorrow or day after I'll be sending in like the second\n15:17\nmilestone perfect and you know could we these are really fun to look at if\n15:23\nyou've got that link handy uh drop it in the chat because these project catalysts\n15:28\nif you're interested in gimbal abs and you want to contribute more if you look at those reports you can really see some\n15:35\nyou know there's really no onstage backstage sort of thing but you can see a little\n15:40\nfarther in uh to some details that we don't we don't cover in this um so\n15:46\nthat's great uh dandelion light Martin yes can you give us an\n15:55\nupdate yeah we moved the governance meeting to Tuesday 1400\n16:02\nUTC um to it's in front of uh Game Changer live coding because then we have\n16:08\nless meetings and we can do it all in one go so let's we hope we have more\n16:15\neffective work time um uh We've commissioned some nfts for the first Den\n16:20\nline node operators and uh these are being made and uh you can\n16:27\nfollow which is now completely working um I've posted the link in the chat\n16:32\nmaybe you can open it um you can see what's uh going on the\n16:38\nNote operators oh you have to yeah\n16:43\nremove there's still some things going on there yeah\n16:52\nyeah there we go nice and then you press M2\n17:01\nlook at this and you can see all the green blocks and the gray blocks are still not doing perfect but yeah we're\n17:08\nworking on it yeah this is beautiful we need six for finishing milstone to or need at\n17:16\nleast uh complying with our you know uh what we need to do uh for Catalyst 13 13\n17:26\n7 13 I think so and um yeah we we have uh two people are uh building new\n17:33\nsystems so then we have six so that's looking good yeah now I yeah I'm\n17:40\nresisting the temptation to dive into this because I think this is like one of the coolest things and I've been speaking with Scott he's one of those\n17:46\nthat's building out a system has anybody else got uh one of these that are here\n17:52\ntoday that that's building out one of the dandelion light nodes\n17:59\nthen okay but this is a great project you can dig into this it's uh it's definitely a way to contribute in a very\n18:05\ncool space age internet generation kind of way yeah and uh\n18:11\nNelson's putting his together we have some uh performance work to do maybe uh\n18:18\nor which we would like uh haura is aggregating all assets and it looks like\n18:24\nit's doing that every block over the whole blockchains so that's uh creating\n18:30\na lot of server load which we would like to get rid of but you\n18:36\nknow it's built on haura which is graphql if there's uh people who know\n18:42\nsome experts who can optimize Azura queries with gra I will uh you know\n18:50\nappreciate some help yeah in that regard if possible\n18:55\nand and harsh I forgot to mention this but that's one of the things that we're asking about uh I also forgot to mention\n19:02\nthis is that during these updates you can you can talk about things that are blocking you or where you can uh where\n19:07\nyou inviting a contribution and help and this is a this is a great way to contribute to as a gimal ABS member or\n19:15\nas a community member um in this uh in this fantastic project that can get you into all kinds of interesting technical\n19:23\num and uh meaningful problems to solve it's really crazy because we have\n19:30\none query and it does all the server load so it's uh it's a yeah I think for\n19:37\nan Optimizer that's that's perfect because you know if you have a million small optimizations that's a lot of work\n19:44\nbut it could be could be very easy for somebody who has the\n19:49\nknowledge so if you are that person out there listening on YouTube or right in\n19:55\nhere hey we are welcoming a Fun Bunch please please please join in uh this may\n20:01\nbe the sign you were looking for all right all right\n20:08\nokay and the next one notion accounts for gimbal\n20:14\nLabs so this is sort of a St um yep it's just ongoing and actually\n20:21\nHinson just put in his first request to be temporarily removed um he doesn't want to give up on participating kimab\n20:28\nbut he recognized he hasn't been so he just volunteer um asked me to take him off of\n20:33\nthat so great little model coming um and we can do an audit of that I think we have that planned for next month or\n20:40\nsomething because I think we originally approved this about a year ago right right and I think I gotta I haven't\n20:47\nreimbursed myself in a couple months I got to audit the last time I did that and I'll let you guys know excellent\n20:55\nexcellent all right all right we're moving right along um which\n21:00\nspaces uh January through June 2025 uh ARA might want to give us update\n21:07\nhere uh that that would be James because this one was uh the The Source was\n21:15\nJames ah okay okay um James do we have\n21:21\nany what's what's happening here this one did we we approve proved\n21:29\nit but we haven't we haven't gone backwards since January to align on\n21:36\nwho's facilitated what um M but it was yeah and then and you and Harsha\n21:42\ntook over this is your third or fourth week on the Thursday open space uh we just got to go back and and\n21:50\nlook at who's facilitated what and then we'll we'll pass those through a project\n21:56\nin andamio where we can all claim uh for what we\n22:02\nfacilitated so basically this one and this is kind of an interesting part of this of the system here we have sort of\n22:09\nin we're using the utxo model of kind of a an input output and this is sort of an\n22:16\noutput proposal for the input of the of the um the Catalyst proposal so this is\n22:23\nhow we're Distributing it and actually one of the one of the community reviews was like hey look we can approve this\n22:30\nMilestone but you have to have um facilitators committed and so we've done\n22:36\nthat but now we're going to put those things into the andamio uh project model so that this\n22:42\nwill become a project and then that's how we'll distribute the treasury funds it's a very very forward thinking um and\n22:49\nInnovative project um that second nature Nelson amongst some\n22:56\nothers are are leading the way on some project auditing features the real goal\n23:01\nhere is to be able to spit out a simple report that can be submitted as Catalyst evidence right if if you're already\n23:07\nusing that system so that that's not something we'll have by the next time we submit Milestones but certainly by the\n23:14\nend of this year um that's something we're really excited to have beautiful beautiful\n23:21\nbeautiful all right and I think I can go back like this and I think that brings us to the\n23:30\nend of the end progress and paraa what do you think um\n23:36\nmaybe ask Alex to come up and talk about some of the ones in backlog or\n23:44\nplanning yeah yeah uh so yeah so I yeah go ahead go ahead\n23:50\nAlex well there's one and it's pretty short so if you open\n23:55\nbacklog uh you will see there\n24:00\nuh contribution Bounty PR 6657 this one here uh yeah so I created\n24:09\nwe approved it uh in December I think I worked on this proposal from June till\n24:14\nDecember and the idea was so that people who do open source contributions to core\n24:20\ncardana can show up for the treasury and show their work and then uh ask to be\n24:27\nreimbursed and then uh like the amount of money that I requested wasn't uh you\n24:36\nknow I didn't want to bring it up to talk about it uh but uh now a situation\n24:44\nhappened and I thought like oh and the the amount of money that the James\n24:49\nsuggested that time and the amount of money that I owe someone now is just exactly the same so I thought oh maybe\n24:56\nthere's still money in the treasures since we approved it and so there's just that uh approval for the transaction uh\n25:04\nand unless there are objections to do this because we talked about this in December said yeah we should like this\n25:09\nis good use of Treasury we could do this and uh yeah there's all and and Alex do you\n25:18\nwant to like give us like an update on this proposal just just the way we did with the rest of the The Proposal is the\n25:25\nupdate okay so there's there was an issue open somewhere uh right so there is a request\n25:34\nby someone uh from the cor from the team at plutus there was some work needed to\n25:40\nbe done and I did it and uh the technical details I poly remember at the\n25:47\nmoment because you know this was something with hustle and plutus right\n25:52\nso I dig into it at the moment when I was doing it it took me some time to figure out\n25:59\nout and yeah if you'd like to contribute to cor cardo that's like really welcome\n26:06\ncan guide you through uh this is a very straightforward process from time to time when you have the uh on boarding\n26:14\ntasks open like this one uh and yeah if you'd like to do that just contact me I\n26:21\nwill help you find the task and walk through it and uh if you get stuck can\n26:27\nuh maybe help you myself or can maybe\n26:33\nask around or you just uh show up for working group meeting for the project\n26:38\nyou'll be working and ask there so this is uh how we do like normally do\n26:45\nmaintenance and prog progressing towards being core cardana developers you want to work on plutus card node uh whatever\n26:54\nlike 40 repositories intersect manages right now and we're planning I am\n27:00\npushing initiative to do this on the intersect side because this is not a good use of eops to fund the you know on\n27:08\nboarding to uh we should do it in a proper way from\n27:14\nintersect but meanwhile I'm working out this initiative and the\n27:21\nactually Community uh debates the budget and the the whole thing with that\n27:28\nand the dumpster fire of governance is being put out until\n27:34\nthen uh this is kind of developing slowly and the proof of concept that I\n27:41\ncame up with last year is this gimble Up's proposal here right so I\n27:49\nwonder I feel like this needs to change its phase possibly the in progress because\n27:56\nif you've you've working and you're just waiting to get the funding from gimal AVS maybe it's in progress right because\n28:03\nit's not done and it's not any we've already consented to it so change be the\n28:09\nfunds are distributed yeah yeah yeah and then we can add a comment uh yeah Alex\n28:16\nupdated uh today and uh waiting waiting for opinion\n28:23\num how about\n28:31\nthat oh yeah that's exactly what it is okay cool and and uh and then we can we\n28:39\ncan go through this um to see how to do it because we may put it into anomo\n28:45\nproject maybe it's part of a bigger thing we'll look we'll look at it um but it might leave the scope of this sort of\n28:53\nproject update uh is that does that sound correct Alex\n28:59\nHara or James yeah yeah I think that's\n29:04\nfair okay um Alex while you're are here\n29:11\nbecause it's like one of the juicy bits about this time and I I think like we we\n29:19\nwere uh almost halfway through the meeting um so this would be a time if\n29:24\nyou're not standing like me to move around and enjoy um uh kind of reset um\n29:31\nI noticed Alex there were several\n29:37\nprojects with you as the owner while I've got you on the line do you want to\n29:43\nupdate any of these or do we want to move any of these to sort of backlog or\n29:49\num oh sure let's look through them so uh\n29:55\nyeah yeah with the Russian gimal UPS chapter I'm facing the\n30:01\nblocker which is uh I'm concerned about my personal\n30:07\nsafety like right security of my life and health because uh the way I see what\n30:14\ngardana does now is stepping on a lot of toes and powerful people in Russia especially those who do oil gas and\n30:22\ninternational trade right and so if we push this initiative right now I'm\n30:28\naction from anyone I'm just too vulnerable to be you know killed by\n30:34\nsomeone without much F so this is in a planning stage we're waiting for a good\n30:40\nmoment where I can talk openly with Russian people about uh why I'm actually\n30:47\nmaking progress now on this proposal because I'm attending effective fism\n30:52\nbook club on why Nations fail which will happen in four days and why Nations fail\n30:58\nis a book from Noel laate from 2024 which talks about inclusive political institutions and Economic\n31:05\nInstitutions in countries as the driver for Success because inclusive political institutions Foster uh investment and\n31:13\nInnovation and without them country Any Nation is doomed to\n31:19\nuh devolving where one group of people expose other group of other groups of\n31:25\npeople which we have in Russia right now and and uh yeah so this is slowly progressing but this is not a proposal\n31:32\nwhich can be completed in the scope of I think it's open for more than one year now so it's in a planning stage uh I no\n31:40\nit's not in a backlog I'm actually working on it it's sounded proposal I yeah if you want to move proposal\n31:49\nstage uh from planning to proposal why why is uh what's the point\n31:57\nlet's leave yeah I mean there leaving it where it is it's good um in the interest of time do you feel like any of these um\n32:06\nmight uh deserve a phase change um or any that you want to highlight just in\n32:11\nthe in the uh in the in a brief in a brief way uh the stream on boarding\n32:18\nexperience through bouny treasury mechanism can be moved to uh I'm working on with intersect on\n32:25\nit right now uh is a open source of program I don't know it's going to be because uh there's just uh too much\n32:32\nuncertainty about budgets and things like this so you can put it into backlog\n32:37\nuh okay because it will probably if I implement it it will use andamio okay because it's has to be the\n32:45\nway to go yeah otherwise other proposals are looking for facilitators who want to\n32:50\npick it up okay okay cool um you Harsha\n32:56\nwhat do you think uh I think we can look for consent uh in\n33:03\nthe consent uh category and see if anyone wants to go forward with the consent process right so this sort of\n33:11\nfinishes up our um oh wait a minute did we no yeah yeah now we go over into\n33:19\nreview and consent anyone have updates about these now this is where it gets\n33:26\ninteresting um and these are in no particular order but if anybody wants to jump yeah\n33:34\nI want um this Shaggy here I just want to jump in and say that I've got that gimbal abbs marketing plan pulled up and\n33:42\nI am interested in participating um okay I think I\n33:47\nmentioned this what is it like two or three weeks ago um we touched on that a\n33:53\nlittle bit but I see man it's got a lot of work that needs uh needs done still so I'm uh I'm interested just I guess let\n34:00\nme know who all's taking point on that I see Sebastian on here but that's about it yeah and that uh perfect something\n34:10\nabout it we open a channel in the Discord in\n34:18\nthe channel dedicated to this topic about the marketing plan uh it's in\n34:25\nthe let's let me see can I I'll be fired\n34:31\nup you guys get to see whatever is on my Discord yeah you you know you you\n34:38\nprovided there the I asked you in a few\n34:44\na few days ago the the the the mapping driver of of gimal ABS as in input to\n34:52\nstart start building the the marketing plan so I can find it in this find it in\n35:00\nthis moment but you can go to to galops there I opened a channel dedicated to\n35:05\nthat for for the people that is interested on on start building this\n35:10\nmarketing right ER you are interested I Al I thinkon and other people is\n35:18\ninterested are interested in this exercise ah here it is right here\n35:24\nokay yeah community onboarding and then this thread here that's right\n35:30\nso let's see and there that's that's the the the the the starting point starting\n35:36\na space where we can start building something right and I can provide my help about it but the idea is to to push\n35:44\nthis marketing thing H an a step further so uh and that requires a\n35:52\ncreation of a marketing St document so you can go there and I I my\n35:58\nintent was to provide the initial documentation and resources that can can\n36:05\ncan can provide the first ideas of how to to build a more robust uh robust\n36:12\ndocument right so that's the my my first that\n36:17\nthat would be my my first thinking about how to start nice thanks um\n36:26\nand yeah Shaggy does that's that gives you a little little way to start in\n36:31\nthere I think the uh having that Discord uh Channel might be a way to\n36:37\nsort of see what's happening on it uh paraa this might into and\n36:44\nunfortunately we are dropping the ball because we don't have a uh um a proposal\n36:50\nbut it's around this part we talked about this I think maybe last week about\n36:57\num Discord maintenance oh we do have a proposal for it Discord it's pretty much\n37:05\na boiler plate one so I think we should move that to planning and when we have it ready we can move it to the consent\n37:11\nphase yeah where is it uh where is\n37:17\nit let's see so basically Discord so Hinson led a group\n37:24\num uh uh re organizing the Discord with this latest generation I think it's been\n37:30\nclose to a year I think it was about a year ago and we actually did a proposal\n37:36\ndocument but we did it on hinson's notion page um so it's not in the this\n37:43\nthis iteration um but back then we thought that we would be working in more\n37:49\nof a sociocratic model um Circle but the\n37:55\nway it shifted and correct me if I'm wrong har it seems like we have moved over into a\n38:02\nproposal and so that each proposal becomes a a circle if you will and\n38:09\nbasically I think it's pretty I think we so basically we wanted to\n38:17\nrevise uh the categories in Discord so like I've talked about from circles to\n38:25\nproposals um we have a category for playground and then what about Integrations like integration with zoom\n38:32\nand integration with notion we just wanted to think about Discord and and it\n38:39\nwas actually Sebastian's uh tension to use that that term from so sociocracy S3 he had\n38:46\nattention he's like I have this proposal about marketing but I don't have\n38:52\nanywhere to put it um so we were thinking\n38:58\nthat that we could move these contribution circles to just be proposals and that in this proposals we\n39:05\nwould create a post with the proposal name so like we've done here with the\n39:11\nAsteria front end um so we we do have that already we which is the all\n39:16\nproposals category right but the circles we are not sure how to like go about\n39:23\nthis circle should we keep them should we not keep them are they useful so we are also looking for feedback of how\n39:30\nyou guys would like it to be so that it makes things easier for you all to communicate and move things\n39:40\nforward and with that in mind um basically I I'll and I'll share\n39:48\nthis proposal um and maybe we'll uh maybe we'll bring this up in\n39:57\nour or consent in the in the in the next weeks um but does everyone sort of\n40:03\nunderstand that problem or does they have any any clarifying questions and because we're already 50 minutes in and\n40:10\nwe haven't done a round let's have a little round do you feel um that the Discord needs some do you understand\n40:18\nthose those issues that I outlined about Discord and do you think it's time to make a uh uh a change or or or revise\n40:26\nthe Discord um and we'll we'll we'll do a round if I can find everybody's\n40:33\nname can I add something real quick Newman yeah go ahead sh within the last\n40:39\nyear Discord did push out an update that created like landing pages and all sorts\n40:45\nof other stuff so I would highly recommend at least addressing Discord in\n40:51\nthat manner to cover that new landing page model and how it allows users to\n40:57\nselect what channels they're interested in ETC you know so at the very least I feel like that's a necessity um maybe\n41:05\nnot a full overhaul so to speak uh but yeah I I would highly recommend addressing that because as a new member\n41:11\nof the Discord I think it's yeah it's definitely low yes yes yes\n41:18\nyes um so that's a that's a good um that's a good start to the round um\n41:24\nlet's see uh uh I'm a oser so I hey James what do you think and then uh\n41:31\nAdrian I think learning like leveling up how we use\n41:37\neach of the tools we use right like there's no question at this point that we use Discord and there's no question\n41:42\nthat we use notion in some reg regards so like learning about those apis and\n41:48\nintegrating how they work together is a really good idea um and I would love to BU build web 3 tooling to interact with\n41:55\nboth of those so I think there's the sky's the limit in terms of how we pull these pieces together um I would also\n42:02\nsay that if we level up our talents using the latest GitHub excuse me the latest Discord\n42:08\nfeatures um there's that's just there's some value in that um Beyond this\n42:14\nproject so uh yeah I would love to build our capacity for that that's beautiful\n42:19\num Adrian and then Alex what do you think about uh what about\n42:25\nDiscord yeah I think uh it's a good idea to make a new Discord or a new structure\n42:32\nDiscord but I'm not sure about is C this to proposals that sounds to a complete\n42:38\noverload so that no one will look into it and they are just existing and only\n42:44\nthe the two people on The Proposal are looking into it but may be wrong and one\n42:51\nother question would be when will this uh yeah threats be opened\n42:57\nfor every proposal that's in the back doog because yeah I think then we would\n43:03\nhave a lot of them ah right right right right that's those are good those are\n43:08\ngood clarifying questions um and in the nature of round we'll we'll address them\n43:15\nat the end or in a in a follow on session um Alex thanks Adrian Alex and\n43:21\nthen Andrew well you know me I'm a conservative I don't like sh things but\n43:27\nJames has a very nice point about uh how the change of technology is actually pushing us to change ourselves and this\n43:34\nis basically what I think why people I need to do card because otherwise uh\n43:41\ntechnology will just get stuck in one place one point so yeah if they able in\n43:48\nwining want to redesign squ I monitor it every day it's one of my top discords at\n43:53\nthe moment I see activity in chill chat technical but uh the you know there's less\n44:00\nactivity in the uh proposal channel so maybe it makes sense to move the active chats to\n44:09\nthe top but then again it depends on who is the user and whose perspective from\n44:14\nthere just uh if possibilities of what's better and what's worse interesting okay\n44:21\nthat's a good point like where the activity is in the Discord right now okay um thanks Al and then uh Andrew and\n44:30\nuh Hara you mean me I think it was just\n44:38\nAlex yeah yeah um oh oh I'm sorry yeah Andrew um what what do you think yeah\n44:44\nyeah I think discord's a key too um uh so a hope really for us because when\n44:50\nwe're not meeting here it's the way we communicate uh yeah so if there's ways maybe we\n44:56\ncould do a bit spring clean um introducing some new categories taking away some old and maybe a review into is\n45:02\nthere an even better way we can use it and fair enough yeah minded to\n45:08\nit nice I like that is there a better way to use it and the idea of a spring clean that's great um uh Caesar answered\n45:16\nin the chat he said that he doesn't necessarily have an opinion that's that's cool um uh harsh you're part of\n45:24\nthe um you're part of The Proposal so we'll skip skip you um Isaiah uh are you\n45:30\non the Discord do you have an opinion about this have you seen discords used in a different way you want to chime in\n45:36\nsure sure so I'll be honest with you um I won't say that I've been on there a lot but just from what it sounds like\n45:42\nyou know I feel like you know spring cleaning is always good and if you're you know learning new things and you're absorbing new things then why not uh you\n45:50\nknow want to implement those things so um yeah if that's another platform that can continue to be used then yeah\n45:57\nabsolutely you can go for it yeah yeah okay cool um Martin thanks Isaiah uh\n46:05\nMartin and then mix uh yeah I'm I'm good with it don't\n46:11\ndelete the dad line Channel okay don't delete it don't\n46:18\ndelete the dandel channel yeah I of course yeah yeah yeah I think it's mostly around those things but uh that's\n46:25\na good that's good feedback of course um mix and then scottt well uh first of all please bring\n46:33\nback music share to Discord that was one of my favorite Channel music sh yeah but uh besides\n46:42\nthat sure uh Discord like any other needs uh maintenance tidiness you know\n46:49\nthings get messy after a while and of course uh we are updating and upgrading\n46:55\nourself on our community definitely Discord should reflect that as well but regards to the integration with zoom I\n47:03\nhave some question and actually this agreement uh and maybe a suggestion as well uh my question is why\n47:11\nZoom I why exactly Zoom what do uh that\n47:16\nintergration is going to do the integration between Zoom as Discord that\n47:21\npart is not clear to me and if there there are you know there is uh some sort\n47:29\nof advantage of Zoom I would love to know as well compared to other solution for\n47:35\nexample Google meet and why Google meet because Google meet and the whole Google\n47:41\necosystem I think would create more Advantage for our community rather than\n47:47\nuh Zoom which is more specific with in Google meet we can bring application\n47:52\nsure in Zoom we have kind of Apple Store as well but in Google meet we can bring bring one application we can bring AI\n47:59\nnotaker transcript uh we have calendar we have uh doct Shure we have ai Studio\n48:06\nwe have ai Workshop notebook you know all sort of AI stuff whereas Zoom is just you know Zoom\n48:14\nit's just video uh Zoom just works atrociously on\n48:20\nAndroid exactly so I suggest uh taking uh into\n48:27\nconsideration of Google meet and not just for being again a video conference\n48:33\napplication but in fact integrating into Google uh e Google ecosystem in general\n48:41\nand Notions uh really good with Google as well we can embed uh Google Sheets\n48:48\ndocuments in notion it's easy actually you can edit or do stuff inside notion\n48:56\nbut on those documents and sure it's go right we can\n49:03\nhave all sort of apis and you know stuff maybe if we need uh servers there will\n49:09\nbe gcp we can have again all sort of again integration um you know it's like from\n49:16\nthe day uh the F the F first day the day one so that that that is so my first\n49:23\nyeah again question would be why Zoom uh I mean so sorry why what do we want to\n49:30\ndo as integration like to zoom with Discord what would be that integration or look like or the plan and why Zoom\n49:37\ncompared to other solution and yeah my suggestion about the whole Google meet and actually\n49:43\nGoogle ecosystem I love it I love it I think that's one of the that's a that's a\n49:49\nfeature not a bug of these clarifying rounds because it's like oh we're going to we're talking about um you know\n49:55\nrevamping or spring cleaning you know uh adjusting one tool Discord but it also\n50:01\nit's like hey maybe we need to reflect on these other tools especially when we start thinking about integration and\n50:07\nwe're Builders so like what can we build with Zoom versus what can we build with those like how does notion fit like uh\n50:14\nso beautiful that's a great comment um mix thank you thank you thank you um\n50:20\nplease don't forget music share guys oh first off yes that's right I'm gonna I'm\n50:25\ngonna bold that I'm Bolding music share okay all right um Scott then Sebastian\n50:33\nand then Simon so I'm gonna go antix at this time I am so anti it is\n50:40\nunbelievable um the problem like all right so I was part of the Catalyst team\n50:46\nback in 2022 21 and 22 and a lot of those docs were in Google whatever\n50:51\nsomebody's Google drive somewhere and so those were the Google docs for this\n50:57\nparticular meeting and they're 404 now and so that's the issue with Google um\n51:03\nversus self-hosting maybe something on chain or you know spun up on the nodes or something like that I don't know um\n51:10\nsomething like iagon but not iagon and uh and then the other thing I've noticed\n51:16\nbeing part of the D Collective is that when it comes to Google doc sharing and um the async editing or co-editing\n51:24\ncommenting anything like permissions are very finicky as far as who's allowed to\n51:30\nactually access that document and um so yeah requiring a\n51:35\nGoogle account to participate uh is a hindrance and we we go the Google route\n51:42\nwe need to make sure that permissions allow everyone um and also I like to say\n51:47\nthat there is G GitHub integrates with Discord how it's used is completely upon uh up to the\n51:53\ncommunity um so there are options out there that's\n51:59\nall beautiful yeah um that is certainly uh an an issue about about the Google\n52:06\nand I do remember the old days and Catalyst man oh my god um Sebastian and\n52:11\nthen uh assignment yeah I'm not objection to to\n52:18\nthe maintainance of the this Discord it's pretty\n52:24\nnecessary yeah and we have to do something we have to to to do something about it yeah agree Co thanks\n52:33\nperfect man Simon my man what's up yeah same here um makes total sense\n52:40\num Discord is obviously one of the main channels for chimber laabs and also kind\n52:45\nof used as a communication tool between the members so it should be maintained\n52:54\nregularly and there should be some some budget for that excellent\n53:01\nyep priority okay so um\n53:08\nHara uh what's up I I kind of like zoned out sorry yeah yeah you're good you're\n53:14\ngood I'm going to so I don't feel like we are at like this clarifying round is\n53:20\ngreat I would love to um take what we've gotten in this feedback and sort of uh\n53:27\nrevamp that proposal um you know the real the next thing and when we look at\n53:32\nthese proposals maybe I'll share my screen when we look at these proposals we really look at like a short hey what\n53:39\nis this and then what is the ask like what are we asking from the community\n53:44\nand in this for instance in this Discord um it's kind of an interesting ask\n53:50\nbecause we use it all the time um for instance mix with the music share in the\n53:55\nlast round of of iteration we lost something that he really loved which was the music share um so it's sort of you\n54:05\nknow when you move the cheese as they as they say um it's important to really think about and uh and come up with\n54:13\nspecific uh questions um so I think what I'm what I'm asking is are we ready to\n54:19\nuh revamp this proposal and bring it in uh to the uh in a in a future meeting\n54:27\nto you Hara um it really is up to like what\n54:34\nevery on things because I I have heard some suggestions where like some things need to change so I think we can I don't\n54:41\nknow how to like get feedback or like ask for suggestions yet but yeah I think\n54:48\nwe might as well draft like a proposal and bring it in and see if people are okay with it or not all right all right\n54:55\nyeah exactly so that's that's I think where we stand with that one um I am\n55:01\nwhat's the can I ask real what's the primary goal for like or purpose for\n55:08\nDiscord for you guys is it just a means of communication or I mean I see you\n55:14\nguys use the scheduling events and stuff like that you guys host workshops in\n55:19\nthere or is that all hosted elsewhere that's a great question love\n55:25\nthat question yeah and I I wish we could do I wish Discord had like the meeting\n55:32\nfeatures that Zoom or Google meet have like scrapping scrapping either one of\n55:38\nthese tools and doing all live events in Discord would be really nice but it's just too hard to record things I there\n55:45\nmight be some ways to like live stream from there but I haven't looked into that yet but that's another option right\n55:52\nlike could is is it possible if we learn enough about disc cord that it's the\n55:58\nreplacement for zoom and Google meet right right\n56:03\nright yeah we do a so that yeah 21 events per week in our Juke boy Discord\n56:10\nso it's uh it is usable if you know what I\n56:18\nmean but the problem with Discord is that it's it's uh limited on the number\n56:24\nof live participation that you can have uh where everybody can interact with each other unless it's\n56:31\nboosted correct correct I don't think that would be uh\n56:37\nOut Of Reach for uh for you guys though yeah I think uh it it does throttle at I\n56:44\nwant to say 25 video participants if you're level two and then it goes up to\n56:50\neither 50 or 100 and then you go up from there but\n56:57\nit's exponentially more expensive\n57:04\nright all right U that's a good point though I do think one of the\n57:11\nfoundational parts and it's kind of comes from S3 is that each one of our features or components of the community\n57:18\nhave a a driver and we have a big community driver we put at the top of\n57:24\neach proposal um to provide open replicable safe spaces to learn to explore to empower individuals and\n57:31\norganizations anywhere so we can solve meaningful problems and then that each proposal has a driver but really this\n57:38\nsort of driver mindset can like what is my personal like Newman's driver like what are what are my motivations and\n57:44\nwhat are my contexts and then for every tool and integration that we have uh can\n57:49\nalso sort of this is its driver like what is the situation that Discord is\n57:56\nresponding to and and with that it if you have that stated it allows for an\n58:05\neasier Evolution or innovation because you can say oh look we're using Discord for asynchronous communication and uh\n58:13\nZoom for meetings and perhaps they you know their contexts get get uh um mashed\n58:20\nup together so this is a great discussion um\n58:26\nI'm recognizing that we have 20 minutes left um I would love\n58:35\nto discuss the next\n58:42\nproject um did we put it hold up let's see oh\n58:49\ndear start here I'm just going to look at our because I know I I do know that Scott\n58:55\nand have been working on the D proposal and I would love to give an update on that at least and perhaps some\n59:02\ndiscussion um which was down down here this D\n59:11\nrepoll um let's uh does anyone have any\n59:17\nobjections to doing that the other one that we would want to talk about would be uh p and the user testing um do you\n59:25\nwant to give an update on that briefly and then we could maybe spend the rest of the time on on\n59:35\nDS um just one thing I'd like to bring back to the surface as well for just folks who are working on the marketing\n59:42\nconversation um I still don't have a clear answer as to what we are marketing\n59:47\nand I feel like we should only be talking about marketing if there's actually a market and we're trying to\n59:53\nsell a product there um if if we're only marketing just to get more people to come to meetings like this that actually\n1:00:00\njust creates more work that we don't get paid for um so I I think I think it's\n1:00:06\nworth it if the marketing conversation starts to take off um that a\n1:00:11\nprerequisite to that be like that we start to Define like what is the product that gimal apps uses to sustain\n1:00:20\nitself so I the way I wrote that down is like what is the driver for the marketing and what is the product that\n1:00:26\ngimal abbs is marketing is that yeah thanks I think it's sufficient\n1:00:32\njust to have it on in in all of our minds as we keep going with a potential marketing proposal thank you for\n1:00:38\nthat no worries uh Simon and Shaggy have\n1:00:44\ntheir hands up go ahead we may want to address this right now or um or move on\n1:00:50\nright yeah I mean absolutely that makes absolute sense and that is also why I want to do the marketing strategy right\n1:00:57\nthat is um where we set the goals of the marketing and that also ties into the\n1:01:04\ngoals of um of chimber laabs and I did find I looked at the goals last\n1:01:11\nweekend um and it was um something on the lines of getting developers into\n1:01:18\ncardano and building and I think that is something where marketing can help right\n1:01:24\nget people to gy chimber labs and then have chimber Labs execute um you know\n1:01:31\nthe the education plans that you always have to get people to build effectively\n1:01:37\non cardano okay\n1:01:45\nokay um thanks for that Simon yeah that definitely is a conversation that um I\n1:01:50\nknow that you are you've been focused in on on quite a few different projects and I'm really thankful that you're here for\n1:01:57\nus um and Shaggy yeah you got both the both the\n1:02:02\nmarketing cats wanted to punch in on this that's good all right I I just want to kind of second what seon said here\n1:02:10\nand focus in on marketing andamio as a platform because I'm be honest with you\n1:02:16\nguys until Randall came into my Discord specifically to talk to me about andamio\n1:02:22\nI had no idea what this was um and then Steve kind came behind and explained a lot and\n1:02:28\nhooked me up with some stuff so it's very underexposed in my opinion uh it's\n1:02:33\na pre-existing platform so I'd focus on andamio and then something for you guys as gimal ABS to\n1:02:40\nconsider um consultancy work bro like if you guys feel you you have a team that's\n1:02:47\nup for it I could see you guys being that kind of yeah you could sell that as\n1:02:52\na service absolutely and whether it's like just Consulting with businesses and Brands looking to come here and build\n1:02:58\nproducts or Consulting with educational institutions or people wanting to put\n1:03:04\neducational content together these are Services you guys could absolutely turn into something to Market but just my two\n1:03:12\ncents on that I really think the andamio platform is where I would highlight efforts um that and then Discord\n1:03:19\nmembership you know uh as much as you said having more people come to the\n1:03:24\nmeetings James for require you know just kind of gives you guys more work it also can increase the you know like the the\n1:03:32\nthe hands rowing the boat if you know what I'm saying so it would probably be good to see more people attending here\n1:03:39\nand there just my thoughts perfect\n1:03:45\nperfect all right I would love and thank you thank you for that I'm I'm really stoked that\n1:03:52\nthis the marketing plan uh getting it into something that really effective and and is edifying to what we're doing here\n1:03:59\nuh what we all are doing here on cardano and in gimal Labs you know one of the things that gimal Labs you know we do a\n1:04:07\nlot of stuff at gimal labs and one of those things is the D so I would like to take the last you know or this next bit\n1:04:15\nof space um and uh sort of frame up and give an update about um the DP um\n1:04:23\nprocess we uh Scott and I presented it maybe it was last week or the week before last um\n1:04:31\nand we wanted to give an update and it is\n1:04:39\nhere and this is this is sort of the update um we really want to hear uh from\n1:04:45\nyou all about the D and how this D function might work here in gimble laabs\n1:04:50\nand so here are some questions they're on the on the um the notion page um\n1:04:56\nand Scott just sort of follow along and if I'm missing anything uh we can we can address um what is the priority of the\n1:05:03\nDP function at at gimal Labs is it is it something that we you know it's a high\n1:05:09\nlevel of priority a low-level middle um what level of participation from a\n1:05:15\ntypical gimbal Labs member is appropriate or wanted um how do we\n1:05:20\nprevent the reinvent the wheel or reinvent the Broken Wheel um of sort of\n1:05:26\ncommunity governance and and things like that how do we learn from the past uh\n1:05:32\nand here's a question do we feel an urgency to change the way we do it now\n1:05:40\num and and then how do we gauge or collect Community input uh sentiment uh\n1:05:48\non individual governance proposals so that I think is like a fundamental thing like these governance proposals are\n1:05:54\nhappening all the time and how do do we how do we collect the the uh the\n1:05:59\nsentiment or how do we get input from our community the people that are here now um so here are some more here's some\n1:06:06\ncomments um there are several D proposals in our notion that I we we're\n1:06:12\ngoing to try to consolidate um the purpose of this proposal this uh D process for gimbal\n1:06:19\nLabs um is uh to organize a process for\n1:06:25\ngimbal Labs that makes sense for us it's appropriate for us that you know that has like a defined you know things so\n1:06:33\nthat then we can change it you know um our fear or our concern is that this\n1:06:38\nproposal drags on and that the D function of gimal labs is draining energy\n1:06:44\nunnecessarily um Scott yeah go ahead like what do you what can we add no I\n1:06:50\njust wanted to um that's what yeah that's what we covered then also down at number four of actually So based on the\n1:06:57\nfeedback from last week I added more\n1:07:03\nlike for at the process start section uh hoping to address some of those concerns from last week as well so I just want to\n1:07:10\nmake that uh known and maybe uh people in the community can look at provide\n1:07:16\nfeedback right so this so we're editing uh these uh this proposal and so you can\n1:07:21\ncheck back from time to time if you're interested in the uh in the D D rep um\n1:07:27\nproposal um in the short time in the 12 minutes that we've got left um I would\n1:07:36\nlove to do and we'll get two two clarifying question rounds um uh let's\n1:07:43\nlet's try to get through a a clarifying question round on this DP process and so\n1:07:50\nanything any of those questions that I asked uh above or any comment that You'\n1:07:56\ngot about the D role or anything like that would be appropriate um H how about\n1:08:03\naround for that yeah I just want to point out too\n1:08:08\nI'll put it in the chat there are currently three proposals that are active\n1:08:15\non oh boy they have still have not voted on that and some of those close soon um\n1:08:22\nso not trying to push us forward like Newman and are the people who are going to put all this together is just making\n1:08:29\nthe community aware of the importance of this and also since uh DP inactivity was\n1:08:36\ndiscussed I think a couple of weeks ago as well yeah uh hey Scott I we posted\n1:08:42\nthat picture that scen oh here it is here it is right here so these are the current uh\n1:08:50\ngovernance actions that are going on um Let's do let's do a governance action\n1:08:57\nround or uh a clarifying question round and in this\n1:09:05\norder uh I'm gonna start with Adrian and then\n1:09:11\nAndrew so me personally um yeah I'm don't want to spend too much time on\n1:09:19\nyeah the governance uh I think we don't have to vote on every proposal that's made right\n1:09:27\nI think we should focus on the ones that uh are really yeah that have an effect\n1:09:34\non us like the one with cutting the the treasury um because we have fund through\n1:09:41\nthe treasury so it has an effect on us um but otherwise I think yeah I see I\n1:09:49\nhave no problem with just abstaining the some vs yeah yeah\n1:09:55\nuh that's uh that's great thank you very much um Andrew and then\n1:10:02\nHara uh yeah so um really appreciate all the all the work that you guys are\n1:10:08\nputting in to this governance process um I realize it takes a lot of time I think\n1:10:13\nI mentioned last week I just think the Open Spaces thing I think it needs it\n1:10:19\nown yeah if we're serious about the government thing govern's thing then it probably needs its own environment to\n1:10:26\nexisting Yeah It's tricky because it's timec consuming for for anyone involved really\n1:10:33\num yeah um I think I'll leave it at that I just yeah I think my main thing needs it own space perfect uh Hara and then\n1:10:43\nizy um I I so yeah so I I think at least for\n1:10:50\ngimal labs our priority should be not just which way the vote goes but how\n1:10:55\nmany people did we make that care about governance in itself so yeah I think if\n1:11:04\nthat's the direction we are going I'd be like down for it yeah okay okay that's\n1:11:09\ngood um izy and then Martin all right you guys hear me\n1:11:16\nokay gotcha all right perfect um honestly guys it's been it's just been a\n1:11:23\ngood observation um you know I've just um you know I'm listening with you guys and you know just seeing how everyone's\n1:11:29\nuh you know breaking things down and getting to the common denominator so um\n1:11:34\nyou know I think if I had to put any kind of input in in that regard I would say\n1:11:40\nthat okay okay um Martin and then\n1:11:46\nmix uh yeah I believe in a representative democracy so I defer to\n1:11:52\nmy representative all right cool all right uh and Mi and\n1:12:00\nthen and Scott you're on the proposal so we go from mix to uh uh\n1:12:07\nshagy I second to all the people who commented before\n1:12:14\nme uh especially governance needs it its own Circle space if we didn't want to\n1:12:21\nfocus but uh I don't think we we should focus right now on\n1:12:28\ngovernance unless there there are reason\n1:12:33\nI'm sure we are deep de reps but um getting involved you can't be a\n1:12:39\npolitician but doesn't mean you have to be involved in every politics you know and also in in terms\n1:12:47\nof uh being an effective d uh you can't just be participate in\n1:12:54\nthe major moves or something which will have you know a butterfly effect or something something\n1:13:01\nbigger uh who's going to decide or you know judge that uh that this these uh\n1:13:08\ngovernance proposal will have that effect well it there should be people\n1:13:14\nand resources allocated you know to to judge that to discuss that if there are\n1:13:21\npeople willing to do that sure but if there there are not I don't think we\n1:13:27\nshould even delegate or assign people I I I believe for starting that governance\n1:13:35\nor anything regard to that we should have start with voluntary work uh and\n1:13:40\nthat voluntary work is started to be something serious something beneficial something meaningful and then we can\n1:13:47\nallocate resources to that as well thank you that is a great comment\n1:13:53\nthat's a that's super good feedback um uh uh Simon I see your hand is up but\n1:13:59\nwe're you're going to be uh you're just you're like two more people and then we'll get to you so\n1:14:04\num if it's okay I would like to chump the queue because I have to leave in a minute oh sure go ahead yeah okay yeah\n1:14:11\nso I've always believed when I first heard about this in chimol Labs that it\n1:14:16\nisn't really critical to the mission I think the only way it is critical for the mission it is is to you know impact\n1:14:23\nthe governance in of chimber labs itself otherwise I would just not talk about\n1:14:31\nit but that's just no no that's a great that's a great Viewpoint that's a great\n1:14:36\nViewpoint um yeah and thank you for that uh daggie and then Pon thanks man and\n1:14:42\nsee you later skip Scott oh uh Scott's part of The Proposal\n1:14:49\nso he's so this is just for clarifying the thing yeah gotcha this may be left\n1:14:55\nfield here maybe I'm speaking out of turn these gimal abs tokens in my wallet\n1:15:02\nman why can't we just spin up Clarity votes with the gimbal Labs token being\n1:15:09\nthe voting thing and then you guys can literally just copy and paste whatever the governor's proposal is into that use\n1:15:16\na platform that's already here you know I don't know just a thought and then it can kind of be like a lot of these other\n1:15:23\ncats are saying like they don't really care unless it's going to move something in our Direction I'm sure you guys would\n1:15:29\ntalk about it in a open space leading up to a vote that would matter to us so\n1:15:34\nyeah just my thoughts you know we could streamline that and Clarity did not pay me to say this I'm just we love us their\n1:15:41\nplatform a lot yeah so okay oh that's great thanks shagy um\n1:15:49\nuh Sebastian yeah I think gimal UPS is is not about\n1:15:55\ndevelopers it's about participation that's the reason why many people comes here and participate and be involved in\n1:16:04\nin several areas not only development that's the reason why I see\n1:16:09\nas gimal member people really involved in this direct ER Direct business so I think I\n1:16:18\nwould like to to to have the the capacity of delegate to those that are\n1:16:23\ninvolving in spefic specific areas in this case the rep the rep\n1:16:29\nthing so uh yeah I think I think it's not a problem for me to not being deeply\n1:16:37\ninvolved in in the rep and the the rep situation but delegate to those that are\n1:16:43\ninvolved on that Scott and Newman and and Steve I I\n1:16:50\ntrust so I I know that they can they can make really good decisions on behalf of\n1:16:57\ngims yeah thanks yeah yeah that's a great that's a really good point um I so\n1:17:04\nthat finishes up the round SC um do you\n1:17:10\njust for a minute we've got two minutes left so could you do you have anything burning that you want to address right\n1:17:18\nnow or do you want to take all this back to the uh drawing board no I think it's uh I'm fine with\n1:17:25\ntaking it back to the drawing board though I don't know if we've really acknowledged anything more than a lot of people in the community aren't really\n1:17:31\ninterested in governance so much and I would just like to I would just like to\n1:17:36\nstate that uh there is a conflict of interest I am a DP and gimal abs being a d but uh the conflict of interest is is\n1:17:44\npublic or if not known then I I can make it known myself if I fall into that category if anybody else does and that's\n1:17:51\nsomething that should be considered also the the question the statements about I'm just thinking out loud maybe it's\n1:17:57\nsomething that people think about is that if gimal ABS is only voting uh base\n1:18:03\nbasically self-centered in their voting like what kind of what kind of impact would that have on the community as far\n1:18:10\nas potential on boarding and just basically the generalized um look and\n1:18:16\nappeal of gimal ABS to the broader Community that's it yeah but very much I\n1:18:22\nI I when we get together just put this little Koda on it I want to it feels\n1:18:28\nlike there's that that tension between hey and Pabon like he always\n1:18:34\ndoes phrase it beautifully uh in this moment um not about developers it's\n1:18:39\nabout participation and if we look at our driver I do feel like gimal ab's d\n1:18:45\nand governance and participation has something to do but we balance that with what mix is saying and actually really\n1:18:52\ngood actionable feedback about like voluntary work and and and what Rises to\n1:18:58\nthe level of like us needing to address it there's juicy juicy conversation that\n1:19:03\nuh we're going to make time me and you Scott and we'll bring it up in the in the next meeting oh wow we've come to the end\n1:19:09\ny'all we've come to the end um thank you so much for uh participating uh we will\n1:19:15\nsee you next week um uh and I will uh I'll shut down the recording now",

    "content": "0:02\nall right it's the 6th of March 2025 this is gimal ABS live Open Spaces we get together on Thursdays at 14:30 UTC\n0:11\nto talk about the work we're doing and what we're going to do next um just here's here's your twice annual reminder\n0:18\nthat this is the month of the year where in some countries you change your clocks\n0:24\novernight and I just want to remind everybody if you live in one of those countries the time of this meeting is\n0:30\ngoing to change for you not for everybody else we Peg these meetings to\n0:35\nUTC time and we recognize that no individual is the center of the world so your time zone doesn't matter to us UTC\n0:42\ntime is what matters so just make sure for example if you live in the United States this meeting is going to be an\n0:48\nhour later on your calendar next week uh any questions about\n0:53\nthat so when is that change for you it's not next week so I don't even get me\n0:59\nstarted yeah thank you okay those that I hate it when they do that they keep talking about getting rid of it when's\n1:06\nthat gonna happen you know like this this is kind of the the joy of the decentralized world is for two out of\n1:12\nevery 12 months everybody's walking around jet lagged and there's there's always this couple of weeks period in\n1:19\nbetween when the states and Europe do it where we're just at we're completely confused so just be gentle to each other\n1:26\nfor the next few weeks if somebody doesn't show up and show shows up an hour late or an hour early it's not\n1:32\ntheir fault you know you know what I just realized James huh I've made all my\n1:39\nmarketing and branding material without considering the time change and then I can't even just just\n1:47\nchange the time of the meetings because I always put West African Time and\n1:52\nEastern Standard Time I don't I don't think West African time does you've got\n1:58\nyour work cut out for you we're nobody nobody is jealous of your situation yep\n2:05\nbut uh but that's what we're here for you know getting getting clocks right it's the least we could do and just to\n2:11\ngeek out for a second everybody here recognizes if you've been working on chain that that keeping time on the\n2:16\nblockchain is also a very interesting challenge we could talk about that in depth anytime but you know yeah James\n2:23\npleas is not a stting that this is called dating the professor\n2:29\nyou see what I just did there that's one of my facilitation moves baiting the professor uh he fell for it um that's\n2:37\nfun um so what we usually do at this meeting whatever time it happens to start in your local time zone is we open\n2:44\nup this notion list right here um and there are two links to this list one of them is public I'm going to drop the\n2:51\npublic link into the chat first here it comes and then I'm also\n2:59\ngoing to share the editable link for everybody who has access to that um if you want access to this notion board all\n3:06\nyou have to do is draft a proposal um and people have done that in a V variety of different ways one way is you can\n3:13\nfind somebody on the gimal ABS team who already has access they can help you draft a proposal or you can just grab\n3:20\nthe public link to the proposal document and like demie did this a couple weeks ago he um he created a Google doc as a\n3:28\ndraft of The Proposal shared it with me and then I dropped it in here so we could talk about it and that's the\n3:33\nproposal right here this project board is split into\n3:38\nseveral different sections we've got proposals this is work in progress that\n3:44\nwe might want to do someday and this is a place where different people can start a draft of a proposal none of this stuff\n3:52\nis officially under way yet and a lot of these are still in progress you know\n3:57\nwriting up the details in the planning stage this is similar and we've talked\n4:03\nabout this before we might not need these two different categories for now they're both here um but originally the\n4:10\nidea of the planning part was for projects we already committed to for example Catalyst commitments we make\n4:18\nplans for how we were going to execute on those before moving them to in progress but for the most part these two\n4:25\nsections serve a similar role anybody who has access to this board can jump in\n4:31\nand start drafting a project sorry about the noise outside um backlog similar this is a\n4:38\nplace just to hold good ideas if you're not actively planning or proposing something but there's an idea that you\n4:45\njust want to have on everybody else's radar feel free to drop it into the backlog well functioning agile teams\n4:54\nalways have a backlog because as you're doing work on any project you're bound\n4:59\nto think of 16 things that you want to do next and you only got time for two or\n5:04\nthree of them backlogs are the place to collect all of those good ideas so in\n5:10\nsome happy future where you have some extra time you could go to that list and say oh what am I going to do\n5:16\nnext we spend most of our time on most Thursdays in this section reviewing and\n5:24\nconsenting to proposals that are ready for Community conversation and today I\n5:29\nI'd like to bring a witch spaces proposal that would continue our work from late\n5:35\n2024 um this one's Demis I think this is one on hold this one is on hold but we'll we'll await um him coming back to\n5:42\nhelp out with that uh and then finally we have our projects in progress and\n5:48\nthis is a nice short list now this was unruly I think having eight different projects in progress It's still a lot\n5:55\nbut it's it's common around here because all of these things are moving on different Tim t tables and what we did\n6:01\nlast week because it was the last Thursday in February is we did a quick review of this list and we'll continue\n6:09\nto do that monthly review on the last Thursday of every month so I'm going to\n6:15\nclose this for now but we recognize this as a work in progress and I bet we'll\n6:20\ntouch on some of these things during the Tex standup that follows this meeting\n6:26\ndoes anybody have any questions about how we operate at these Thursday\n6:38\nmeetings cool um so like I said I have one proposal that I would love to bring to everybody for consent today I'm not\n6:46\nsure if we're 100% there there might be some revisions we need to make but before we jump into that part of the\n6:52\nmeeting are there any other proposals that are being planned or drafted that are ready for\n7:00\nCommunity\n7:08\nconsent so the question is are any proposals up for consent right now yeah\n7:14\nif you've been drafting one of these for example this is the part of the meeting where we could switch any of them into\n7:20\nthis community review phase uh I see my name there on the\n7:27\ncontribution ladder for core c uh you know uh Alex hasn't been around\n7:32\nin a minute uh but he is active you know he moved to Vietnam he changed his time\n7:38\nzone uh he uh is active over in the open source uh intersect group um so I've\n7:47\nbeen meaning to reach out to him let if we could let's put that one in uh backlog and I'll I'll uh I'll see if\n7:54\nthere's some because I'd love to get him over here and into a project uh or if\n7:59\nwhat he's doing is aligning in a different way to some of our other projects so I'll put that on my my list\n8:05\nfor any note are is there any note takers here um but hey notaker put down an action item for Newman to uh to reach\n8:12\nout to Alex because I miss him thank you yeah me too um we don't have a notetaker\n8:18\nhere but we are recording and we can always pass the audio through a notetaker later\n8:25\non um some people have been playing with the Google Gemini integration into\n8:31\nGoogle meet and I've been hearing good things about the notes it takes uh so I\n8:37\ndon't know if we want to make a gimal ab's governance decision to move from Zoom to meet at some point I don't\n8:43\nreally have a strong feeling about that but that's the kind of decision we could also make in a meeting like this Steve\n8:49\nwhat do you think I don't have an opinion about that\n8:56\nalthough I will say I'm resistant to change as a general general rule um what\n9:02\nthe reason I raised my hand is I'm not I haven't been clear are are\n9:08\nwe supposed to make a proposal to vote on every governance action that comes up\n9:14\nsince we're a d i mean what's our process how do we want to Def yeah great\n9:21\nquestion I mean where we left off is for the first decision I took the initiative\n9:27\nto write the proposal and then I asked for consent on that it\n9:34\nwas consented to and we registered that decision on chain um if anybody else wants to take\n9:41\nsimilar Initiative for the current decision that needs to be made that's\n9:47\none sure way to make sure that we make a decision if you'd rather stay at the\n9:52\nmeta level and make a proposal for how we make those D decisions\n9:59\nthat's also in play but yeah I would say right now we're in the stage of of\n10:05\nwaiting for those proposals to emerge Newman what do you think so I\n10:14\nuh I've uh about the DP thing yeah it's just it's just something for us to to\n10:20\nfigure out as we go through I figure that when the this next this next one\n10:26\nthat's on we'll sort of we'll sort of see um uh but I realize now that I'm sort of\n10:32\njumping topics there's another another thing that's come up for\n10:37\nme well there's I mean you know there's a this proposal to reduce the tax from\n10:44\n20% to 10% is running until the\n10:49\n15th so yeah it's just been on my mind\n10:55\nbecause you know the dialogue has kind of been growing about it as the date\n11:03\napproaches is there any evidence that the decision for that one would be\n11:08\ntriggered before the 15th or does it look like there's confidence I think it\n11:14\nI think it's going to go to the end right now there hasn't been it's not close to to the threshold either way um\n11:22\nthere's more no votes to it but the yes votes are growing uh what I noticed this morning\n11:29\nwas that last night the foundation voted to deem the action\n11:35\nunconstitutional due to oh I see that they did they they felt like they they\n11:41\ndidn't they didn't provide enough technical research to back up the idea of it which is kind of nonsensical to me\n11:49\nyou know which you know for reasons that they explained in The Proposal but there you\n11:58\ngo yeah yeah I think this is an important one for gimal abs to register a decision\n12:04\non um and it would the experiment here is to find out if anybody's going to\n12:10\ntake initiative to propose what we should vote I I have a difficult time with that\n12:18\nand you know you know saying I think we should vote one way or the other because like a lot of the more\n12:26\num um intangible aspects of governance it\n12:32\nseems to me from the people that I've spoken with it seems to me to be\n12:38\ndetermined by personality right you know like there you know people feel either one way or\n12:43\nthe other about it and that just is more like you know just based on on how they\n12:51\nfeel about social issues in general uh you know like you know because you know\n12:56\nthe reason the reason that they made the proposal was partly because you know taxes should\n13:02\nalways be reduced but also the reason is that you know from\n13:09\nCharles Charles perspective you know they just randomly chose 20%\n13:15\ntax and you know there was no technical reason to go less or more they just\n13:21\nchose that number because it just sounded better and based on that then\n13:27\nthen you get into like your financial perspectives on it right right is is\n13:33\ngoing from you know 300 to 150 million Ada per year in the treasury you know\n13:40\nyou know that's the question Scott and then\n13:46\nShaggy well what makes that 20% tax thing interesting is the paper that was put out by the CF and the CF showed that\n13:53\nif their calculations are correct but they were based on some inactive pools when they were determining the\n14:01\nmedian uh some of the median figures in their formulas uh cf's paper stated that\n14:09\nit's pretty much 32 and a half% is what the tax ends up being instead of the 20%\n14:15\nbased upon multiple other uh variables in their calculations also what's interesting about the tax is that it\n14:22\nreally doesn't like it can be turn you can turn around and and put in another proposal and like it breaks the system\n14:28\nor something that's built into the Constitution um and also I put in in\n14:33\nnotes like there's nothing in the Constitution that states that proposals have to be highly detailed they just have to run through the impacts on the\n14:40\nsystem and whether or not there can pose any type of security issues to my\n14:47\nknowledge Jackie I almost just want to piggyback off of Scott\n14:54\nhere where can I find more information about this like as far as like the\n14:59\nactual research behind how the tax rate impacts the network and then like if we\n15:07\ndon't have too much in the way of research on this or we've only researched it with certain percentages I\n15:14\nmean wouldn't the cf's justification be correct I'm not trying to defend them here I'm just kind of wondering like are\n15:20\nwe lacking in documentation and research on this topic as a network no I think I\n15:27\nthink the proposal itself was fairly detailed you know if you really read all the way through it\n15:34\num the the steak pool operators I know that\n15:39\nthat have been involved and and have viewed\n15:44\nthis seem to agree that 12% more rewards will go to the Stak\n15:51\npools and in my mind because I know\n15:57\nmore I know many more Stak pool operators who have small amount of\n16:03\nDelegation you know I I think that there's there is that benefit to them\n16:08\nthat you know could help them cover their their hard costs in running a steak pool and to me that's that's a\n16:16\nreal benefit I and I\n16:22\ndon't I I do not believe government you know I do not believe the treasury needs an endless large amount of ADA I think\n16:30\nthat's what creates you know bureaucracy so you know less feeding that Beast the\n16:36\nbetter you know that's and that's my personality right that's that's the direction I will tend to think on these\n16:43\nkinds of issues so but that's just me\n16:50\nAdrian I think the treasury is very important because if you think of chimber laabs it is funded through the\n16:57\ntreasury so if we reduce the amount that goes to the treasury it's also more\n17:02\nunlikely that we get some amount of that\n17:09\nTreasury and that's a potential right gimal ab's argument so I want to go back to Steve's original point about\n17:15\ndiscomfort saying we should vote one way or another and I believe deeply that one of\n17:21\nthe things that that will sustain gimal ABS is people recognizing that sharing a\n17:30\ndraft of a proposal is not a way of exerting power it's a service to everybody else because when you put out\n17:37\na proposal where you say we should vote this way or that way and here's why the\n17:43\nservice you're doing to everybody else is you're giving them all something to push back against and to argue with\n17:49\nright I didn't want to be the person to write our first one but I was willing to do it as a service to everyone else and\n17:58\nand what I recognized is that once I brought it nobody really wanted to argue with me hey I'm a co-founder of gimal\n18:05\nABS you don't argue with the boss well we have to break that habit that's one of the hardest things we're going to\n18:11\nbreak around here and I can promise to you that the reason I wrote that proposal was from a service perspective\n18:19\nso for the long-term health of this group of people coming together when\n18:24\nsomebody here does decide to take the initiative to write that proposal you're\n18:30\nnot grabbing power that's not yours you're doing a service to everybody else so that a decision can be made so if\n18:38\nanybody feels blocked by not wanting to be the first person to come forward with\n18:43\na way to look at it I want you to feel unblocked by what I'm saying right now this is how we move forward coming up\n18:50\nwith something so everybody else can call you the idiot that's a service okay and I hope that each of us can be\n18:57\nwilling to do that on the proposal itself all I'll say is I think it's deeply disingenuous to call\n19:05\nthis a tax but like Steve said I'm also coming from my perspective I think I\n19:10\nthink it's yeah I think it's really dishonest to frame this as a tax and\n19:17\nthis is a thing that you know it's very it's very North American Centric to even\n19:22\nname it this way because we have a 300E history of arguing about taxes in a way that we shouldn't have brought to This\n19:28\nGlobal community and Andrew who created this proposal he's a multi-pool operator\n19:33\nright so 12% on his million in in pool\n19:40\npledge is going to make a huge difference for him and I would rather these funds be available to people to\n19:45\npotentially build from the treasury um I recognize the point about\n19:51\nbureaucracy um but I think that you know taking all those rewards and just giving them to Stak pool operators right away\n19:58\nespecially when it's proposed by a multi-pool operator I would rather take the chance that we might have some\n20:04\nbureaucracy than just assume it should all go to those multipos that's my feeling about it so\n20:11\nI've telegraphed what I would write if I was the person taking the initiative to write this proposal but I'm not going to\n20:17\nbe that person this time okay so looking for somebody else to step\n20:24\nup any other proposals that we should bring to the agend genda for\n20:32\ntoday uh can I suggest the witch spaces proposal uh because I submitted like the\n20:38\nmilestone for for f-13 and the reviewer asked I see the proposal but I don't see\n20:44\nconsent so I'm not oh yeah wait that's amazing so they're aware of the consent process that's actually great news yep\n20:51\nlet's get it so that's the one I have here today and I would love to jump into it any objections if we just get started\n20:59\nno objection here and uh a support uh because uh uh there's some stuff that\n21:06\nmight been in my sort of Zone that maybe dropped dropped the ball um so yeah I'd\n21:11\nbe happy to get into this I just dropped the public Link in the chat if you have access to notion\n21:17\nyou know how to get here all right which spaces so I'm calling it January through June 2025 to cover the first half of\n21:25\nthis year I know it's March already and part of this proposal is to ask for some\n21:30\nretroactive funding for people who have done some facilitation work already little quote little um just from\n21:39\na previous meeting learning experience is our Pathway to contribution that's really been com becoming clear around\n21:44\nhere and we support that with our driver just going to read it as usual we we revalidated this driver at\n21:53\nan open space at the beginning of 2025 and it says that our driver is to provide open replicable safe spaces to\n22:00\nlearn to explore and to empower individuals and organizations anywhere\n22:05\nso that we may solve meaningful problems so I for the proposal I'm just borrowing\n22:11\nthat language and building upon it gimal ABS creates spaces where people learn explore build relationships and practice\n22:18\nfacilitation the reason I added this bit about practicing facilitation is I think that's part of\n22:25\nthe replicability right if we're want if we want to be able to create other spaces we need to be able to practice\n22:33\nand facilitation is hard it's it it takes work and I think a lot of us have\n22:41\nhad the opportunity to get better at it by being in this space mix was practicing it yesterday in the new all\n22:48\nthings go session and he did an experiment with with one facilitation method where he's learning something\n22:54\nbrand new in real time and that gave him good about what what he wants to do in\n23:00\nthe future I also think that by naming practice facilitation here we're\n23:06\nempowering people and organizations right the more people who can facilitate\n23:13\nspaces the more people who can lead uncomfortable conversations and make\n23:18\nspace that many voices are heard the better our ecosystem is going to be and\n23:23\nwe're not perfect at that here either but we're trying right and I think think\n23:28\nwe are getting better at it so that's why I included these words in The Proposal driver right here we aim to\n23:36\nprovide both consistency meaning that these meetings happen every week you can\n23:42\ncount on gimal ABS to be here I think that is a big part of our brand and we\n23:47\nrecognize that you can't have those meetings without facilitation this is a proposal to\n23:52\ncommit to those dates and to pay facilitators for fulfilling their role\n23:58\nit's called which spaces January through June 2025 background we need the consistent\n24:04\nfacilitation of weekly spaces so that we can practice what we're doing and so\n24:09\nthat new ideas emerge we want to keep Open Spaces running at the same time\n24:14\neach week we want to get current work done for example ppbl maintainers for\n24:22\nexample aeria for example the handshake work that mix is going to talk about\n24:27\nlater and to the extent possible it's really cool to build in public try to keep the\n24:34\ndoor open while we're doing this work and eventually right if there are other\n24:39\ndevelopers with something to share this has been a core goal that Steve keeps coming back to right if there's people\n24:45\nbuilding stuff and we can learn from each other it'd be nice to have some\n24:50\nspaces for that this proposal addresses I think the first three pretty well and\n24:58\nit doesn't sufficiently address the fourth point but I wanted to have this fourth point on the proposal so that we\n25:05\ncan keep thinking about it intended outcomes let's keep spaces running through May let's make sure facilitators\n25:12\nare compensated let's make sure we're keeping track of what best practices we're learning and let's make sure the\n25:19\npublic calendar is up to dat even despite time changes and then last week\n25:24\nwe added this line to the proposal we can make it possible POS for other\n25:30\norganizations to post events on the gimal ab's calendar that might be a\n25:35\nseparate task but I think it's an exciting one to just name right here if the gimal ABS calendar had some way of\n25:42\nbeing like a more General community resource details um I'd like to propose\n25:48\nthat we pay facilitators 200 Ada every time they facilitate a 90-minute meeting\n25:54\nand I'd like to agree on the regular meeting Cadence to take us through\n25:59\nMay here are the impact and benefits I'm not going to read through these These are unchanged from our previous proposal\n26:07\nif these need to be updated we can do that before arriving at consent and I'm going to open it up to questions in just\n26:13\na minute evaluation criteria trying to keep it simple and\n26:18\nquantitative I'd like by the time we close out this proposal in may just to\n26:24\nbe able to say how many projects did we support and how many decisions did we make together I tried to keep it simple\n26:32\nlike this because I think these are easy things to measure we can look at the different spaces we're maintaining and\n26:38\nwe can just look at the log look here's we worked on these projects and all things go we worked on these projects\n26:44\nand the tech standup and we made these decisions at Open Spaces I think those\n26:49\nare really nice quantitative metrics and we wouldn't have to change anything about what we're currently doing to\n26:56\nstart just keeping a record of that data timeline I've already said it right\n27:02\nlet's go through May I in The Proposal title it says June why I think we should\n27:08\ntake a little bit of time off here the consistency is important uh but that drumbeat of always having meetings in a\n27:16\nweek means that it's really hard to get like a couple days stretch of either just deep work for a few days straight a\n27:24\nhackathon kind of thing um or of course time off is really valuable so I'd like\n27:29\nto also propose that we close gimal abs in June from these regular meetings and\n27:37\nmaybe use that time more flexibly do some experiments with how we use time in\n27:42\nJune these are the weekly spaces we've got all things go now running at 14:30\n27:47\non Wednesdays Open Spaces that's where we are right now 14:30 on Thursdays and the tech standup follows at\n27:54\n1,600 aen live coding Hinson and I have been facilitating that we have some\n28:00\nguests and that project is already funded so it actually doesn't require any funding here but it is on the\n28:06\ncalendar and let's just add that this is Tuesdays\n28:12\n12:30 to 1,400\n28:18\nUTC um the other three are in the scope of this proposal so all things go mix is\n28:24\nfacilitating that he might have some plans to share facil facilitation over the next few months um but so that\n28:31\npayment would go to him or whoever else facilitates Open Spaces this was Newman and Harsha for the first two weeks of\n28:37\nthe Year facilitating a driver mapping Workshop it was me since then and\n28:43\nthrough today and I would love to open it up if anybody wants to practice facilitation\n28:51\nof Open Spaces I would love to support you and I would love to hand it off to\n28:58\nsomebody else I'll still be just as present but I won't be the first voice you hear when we press record um and I\n29:05\nwon't give that tour of notion but we'll hand that off to somebody else for the reasons described above this is why I\n29:12\nreally wanted to point out this part of the proposal driver for all of these\n29:17\nReasons I'm pretty passionate about helping any number of other people to\n29:22\ntake my place facilitating this session and when I open it up if anybody's interested let me know right and this I\n29:30\ndon't know if it's a binary decision I don't know if there's kind of a way we want to ramp up to this um but just keep\n29:37\nthat in mind and then same thing with tech standup this one this one we might need\n29:45\nto be a little bit more creative too with the funding because facilitation is actually a\n29:51\nlittle bit easier at the tech standup and expert advice might be the thing\n29:56\nthat we're looking for so this might be a line that we want to update um but just to put some numbers on it uh start\n30:04\ndate of Open Spaces was the 7th of January and I'm proposing let's go\n30:09\nthrough the middle of May so we can have a nice break for like six weeks or so uh\n30:15\nall things go started last week let's continue it through the same week Tech standup started last week same idea and\n30:23\nso all added together this is 18 sessions plus 11 plus 11 and that's\n30:29\naccounting for a week off in April when Builder Fest is happening a lot of people will be traveling for that um but\n30:36\nthat means we have 40 sessions times 200 Ada the budget will be 8,000 Ada just\n30:42\nfor the facilitation and then if we want to add some lines about reporting or like\n30:48\ncollecting what we've learned maybe we want some budget lines for that and so\n30:53\nthat's why I added reporting we know facilitation is part of this is there some level of reporting that we want to\n30:59\nadd yeah perfect and thanks for taking these administrative notes yeah so let's\n31:06\ncall this\n31:12\nadmin admin and Reporting right yeah and that right now is done by\n31:17\nHara beautiful and that's every okay with that continuing to be a part of The\n31:23\nProposal okay um risks we don't make an impact\n31:29\npeople don't grow as individuals or nobody collaborates right all of these are risks there might be some other\n31:35\nsimpler ones to add so we can feel free to add those and we're starting to build a framework about the life cycle of a\n31:42\nspace we've started and closed down enough spaces over the last few years\n31:50\nthat we're starting to have some pretty clear ideas about best practices for doing this and I do think it would be\n31:55\npretty cool to like report on that uh by the end of this life cycle and then these are just some notes from\n32:01\nearlier about a draft of some other spaces that might go on the calendar and projects that are out in front of us so\n32:09\nI just took us through a review of this initial proposal and this is the part in the process where yeah I'll open it up\n32:15\nto clarifying questions um Adrian is your hand up again or still up from last\n32:21\ntime uh that was not my intention sorry sure um Scott\n32:28\nwhat do you think I was just going to ask uh where's the consideration for platform cost on this or is that a\n32:34\ncompletely separate good we need we need zoom and we need teamup calendar so teamup\n32:41\ncalendar is already paid for Zoom I'm reimbursed\n32:47\nfor but I could imagine a future proposal like we talked about this last week we're paying for notion accounts\n32:54\nfor some people there's could be really nice to draft a proposal where we talk about\n33:02\nother tools that people might get access to and right like would more zoom accounts be helpful um that could be\n33:09\nproposed mix how about you yeah actually I bought that those resources uh at\n33:15\nleast in my case I'm more comfortable of Google meet for some reason the\n33:21\nconnection the video because I'm sharing my uh desktop why\n33:28\nyou know hosting those session is better than Zoom I still I don't know exactly\n33:35\nwhy what's the reason or what is the uh it's the same network I'm using same VPN\n33:41\nsame thing but the quality in Google meet for me at least and the for\n33:47\naudiences which they are observing my screen is better so if there is a\n33:54\nconsideration for assigning or dedicating some resources to this proposal or I don't some future proposal\n34:00\nI would love to you know suggest uh I don't know about buying but at least\n34:06\nconsidering Google meet uh for hosting the these\n34:13\nsessions cool so ideally that would be on Google meet yeah let's let's see if that's feasible and we can make a\n34:19\nsimilar decision for these other ones and also do we have a shared calendar\n34:24\nlike all these people can have these the calendar they they have access for\n34:29\nexample if something happens they are you know something happen that they cannot host a meeting uh how they can uh\n34:39\nreport whom they should report who is the my question is who is the faciliator\n34:46\nof the facors kind of cool so yeah we're going to want uh\n34:55\nmitigation plan for when somebody is unable to facilitate we don't have a shared Google\n35:04\nCalendar and we're there's currently no proposal to have one if we decide to\n35:10\nspend money on Google accounts that would be a unique proposal for now\n35:16\nthere's just the public teamup calendar at gimal abs.com\n35:22\ncalendar but at that link there is published an IC feed that anybody can\n35:27\nuse to subscribe on their own uh but uh is there any faciliator\n35:33\nchannel in gimbal apps kind of like I don't know private or something so that we can all of these faciliator all these\n35:40\npeople can align you know talk with each other if they need something or cover each other that's a good idea so create\n35:47\na facilitator channel in\n35:53\nDiscord like that Newman\n35:58\nall right all right can you hear me okay perfect um uh okay so I got an alert for\n36:05\nthis the fun 13 um uh with spaces and we\n36:11\nuh we put in our first Milestone um the for this and so it's\n36:17\ngreat to sort of uh see this in the in our uh governance now I'm trying to run\n36:24\nthe um do you want to share screen for anything uh yeah you know what let me do that that might be that might be good\n36:31\nthat might be good okay share\n36:36\nscreen okay so you see what I see is that right all\n36:42\nright um so I so we're going through the\n36:50\nclarification uh stage and I wanted to draw our attention\n36:56\nto this is this is kind\n37:01\nof uh ah notion come on buddy oh I can't make it\n37:09\ngo all right this is this huge can I\n37:14\nmake this smaller does look huge here we go here we go it's small now okay so\n37:22\nthis is the little bar okay here we are we're in I'm going to close these down\n37:28\nthis down this down okay everything is down except this so we're in this one so\n37:35\nI wanted to remind us of the Ada inflows and outflows so this which spaces is\n37:42\nconnected to the fun 13 uh um sustain and maintain and if\n37:50\nthis this project here um so I want to draw your attention everybody listening\n37:56\nI want to draw your attention to to this oo is that a 404 look at\n38:02\nthis oh that link is screwy okay what was that link supposed to be to it's\n38:08\nsupposed to be to the to the uh to the this to\n38:15\ncat. yeah I wonder if I could just fix the link really quick but anyway I don't\n38:20\nthink that's super necessary other than to say this is yeah there we go um so\n38:26\nthis is what was funded like we wrote this proposal and we got funded hooray for us okay so if you don't know there\n38:33\nare these Milestones that's how we get funded and we do this proof of achievement so we wrote a proof of\n38:38\nachievement that is uh you know that corresponds with the statement of Milestone this is some project Catalyst\n38:45\nstuff if you're unfamiliar okay so we submitted this Google doc or this PDF on\n38:53\na Google Drive and the lovely reviewer gave us\n38:58\nincredible reviewer notes um and one of the things was this community decides\n39:06\ngimbal lab's driver I'm drilling down to like my my mopa um because as a part of\n39:13\nfacilitating those Hara and I facilitating those two uh meetings uh in\n39:20\nthe governance we call a governance season we didn't finish out so the\n39:26\nreviewer highlights this part which what we did was we said well it's not\n39:33\nimportant all of our uh concerns and objections didn't amount to changing the driver and so we I I I didn't finish it\n39:42\ncompletely basically and put the new new driver here so that's what that's what I\n39:47\npropose to do and then I think that will satisfy this this red x uh mark\n39:57\nokay um back to the notion so that was all like a little side that's some of\n40:03\nthe best Milestone feedback I've ever seen and I absolutely you know usually I\n40:08\nwant to know like who it was so I know like who to chase but like I I this person deserves like a hug and a high\n40:14\nfive this is fabulous and honestly if it is AI because I thought that it is an AI\n40:20\nit's a damn good AI it's a damn good AI I support 100% this Ai No but I do think\n40:26\nit is both AI and human because they have checked everything but also they wrote it with AI I I actually put it in\n40:33\nlike a AI scanning software and it said AI beautiful I I support this 100%\n40:40\nbecause it makes our job easy because we basically just go through these red xes so and and if it\n40:45\nneeds Community to uh uh uh consent\n40:51\nagain I just want to remind everybody that we went through this big process and we came up with the couple of\n40:57\ndifferent things but they didn't rise to the level of changing the driver is\n41:02\nthat's how that's how I saw it and we just said hey let's just keep our primary driver because there wasn't\n41:08\nanything is everybody else sort of seeing it that way and we have a video of that moment right yes that would be\n41:16\nlike the January 14th Open Spaces which is on video there's probably like a\n41:21\ntwo-minute clip you can find in that video where we did consent to keeping it\n41:29\nwe definitely did a voting round on it yeah yeah yeah right okay you can you can explain that\n41:35\nthere is no there was not uh there was just a a a replanning of was not refling\n41:44\nof the of the driver the primary driver it was just a revision of the of the rri\n41:51\nyeah yeah that's right that we basically we went through the process of seeing like how it could change but all of our\n41:57\nconcerns and objections didn't rise to the level of of changing the driver um\n42:05\nyeah expl explain and I can do that I can I can I can do that to solve that um red check\n42:12\nmark but uh but I do want to talk about\n42:17\nthis because I really think this addition to our process of the Ada inflows and Ada outflows one because\n42:25\nit's a utxo kind of Vibe um like we got um inflows but this witch spaces is\n42:34\nmore of an outflow um and so in The Proposal I saw\n42:40\na number what is the total outflow and this is a question to James the The\n42:46\nProposal writer a clarify minimum a minimum of 8,000 plus some reporting and\n42:54\nadministrative stuff whatever that line item should be so maybe what if like\n43:00\nback that's from the that's from the 40 sessions at 200 data each okay right\n43:07\nyeah and then what if we say an additional 2,000 data for admin and\n43:13\nReporting and then we put in some details for what those two things mean right Catalyst reporting obviously but I\n43:20\nput a couple of like R&D questions in here that I think could be interesting\n43:25\nwhat if we said like a th for Catalyst reporting and a th for\n43:32\nR&D\n43:37\nreporting thousand for Catalyst and a thousand for R&D just throwing out numbers right I'm I'm giving you guys\n43:43\nsomething to argue with if those numbers don't feel right R&D meaning research\n43:48\nresearch and development type of yeah yeah you know like like for example this\n43:54\nthis pattern I named of the life cycle of a space is there anything we do we want to publish like a one pager about\n44:01\nthat do we want to publish anything about what we're learning about\n44:08\nfacilitation we could set goals for this do we have are we going to have\n44:15\nsome blog post also some sort that we could add a line for that sure I mean should should\n44:22\npublishing a regular blog post every couple of weeks every month should that\n44:28\nbe in the scope of this proposal I think I think it can be both\n44:34\nI I think there should be a paper and and a blog post you know of the paper\n44:39\nyou know based on our experience and practi in sociocracy V3 you know like\n44:45\nthis is this is the only example I know of where people are really you know\n44:51\ntaking Catalyst money and you know applying it in you know all these different directions I I mean you know\n44:57\nthis this is what makes gimal ABS unique and you know attractive to a lot you know I think it's why we get\n45:04\nfunding so I I definitely feel there should be that kind of\n45:12\ndocumentation great uh great Stephen and is that is that a marketing function\n45:20\nlook at if you draw your attention to this part um we've got sort of admin and that\n45:28\nI definitely see as like Catalyst reporting maybe this is like internal\n45:34\nreporting uh and RD I think it's R&D okay\n45:42\nokay uh do you think R&D fits more into admin or sort of marketing even though I\n45:49\nadded this marketing part because we've got down here under\n45:54\nresponsibilities facilitation uh admin we got admin hosts so what is\n46:02\nthe difference between the admin that I'm doing versus The Catalyst\n46:08\nreporting what is Hara what's the additional admin you're doing outside of\n46:14\ncatalyst reporting just so we can get it in words additional report no there's no\n46:20\nadditional what what addition that's was so yeah admin yeah so I guess Catalyst\n46:25\nreporting is a subset of like the administrative work does that make sense okay okay yeah yeah and yeah I guess\n46:31\nlike we could say I think the admin I think the admin feeds the Catalyst reporting that's what I would that's how\n46:37\nI would phrase it yeah and it's ad I love the word administrivia right like\n46:42\njust there's all this like work that just in it takes up time just getting\n46:47\nMilestones written that that has to be funded and then uh\n46:54\nsebastians uh I think that those are the big so we you can kind of pair up the\n46:59\nresponsibilities with the resources required so this two this 200 Ada is\n47:05\nreally a part of this facilitation and and this facilitation\n47:11\nthen admin and Reporting we've got this admin part but could we I mean I'm just\n47:18\nthinking about Sebastian's uh basically\n47:23\nwho could tracks down uh videos uh posts things to Twitter I think he establishes\n47:31\nthe calendar um those things he makes kickass thumbnails and these SP\n47:39\nthumbnails I don't know where he gets them uh maybe he you know I was going to do a impression but uh so I definitely\n47:46\nthink that is what makes these spaces go so to be included would be great um so\n47:53\nI'm going to type it in right here it's like the the admin site er uh keeps the\n48:00\nthe the rolling all the all the the stop rolling and the marketing and\n48:06\npromotional site and I have to say it's a this is an open space So currently I'm\n48:12\ndoing I'm I'm I'm I'm faing the the this the the spot but it's open to new\n48:20\ntalents so I can the important thing is what marketing and promo\n48:27\ndoes for the general project that is Catal is gimbals right if you have some\n48:33\nnew ideas or you want to be in charge of the marketing and promotional side of\n48:39\ngalops please come and start working on that but the idea of marketing from my\n48:45\nperspective is to to open the gates uh to to the people right to to to to\n48:54\ninvite people to to consume and participate pay in the spaces and keep this this this kind of\n49:03\ncommunication funnel open to the people um I just had a quick question\n49:09\nfor Sebastian on that like Seb we don't have a budget line for that work in this proposal should we add one yeah you\n49:17\nshould yeah not for me but but for the people that the person that can can make\n49:22\nthe job not not for you though I mean right it's it's for you\n49:27\nfor it yeah yeah for people what's fair\n49:33\nfor five months of doing that work of you know and what do you think and once\n49:38\nagain and once again this this is an opportunity to to call all the people\n49:43\ninops members and are interested in maybe give us a a push in in the\n49:49\nmarketing side we have a budget we have a budget assigned to the task so if you\n49:54\nhave a disposition and new ideas and availability to to contribute in the\n50:00\narea please come and and start working on that won't be a a free uh\n50:09\njob yeah if I can just simplify it it's just bring people to these sessions a\n50:16\nsession with one person or empty per empty it's you know it doesn't help\n50:22\nanyone so just bring people yes\n50:27\nyes that's the what it's one of the essentials but and the other is okay\n50:32\ngimal is communicate that gimbal apps is open and\n50:39\nit's live and it's Avail it's open to to everybody it's not disappearing from the\n50:44\necosystem ecosystem space so okay and that and many other things\n50:56\nokay hey Sebastian I have a small question what do you feel about the the\n51:02\npayment that we put in in the previous switch spaces for the for like the for\n51:09\nlike the work that you are doing already yes my opinion is it's fine I\n51:16\ncan't I can I can talk for for the my replace my replacement other people but\n51:23\nfor for the moment for me I I can do I I can with that with that budget\n51:33\nokay and is there and is the does it make sense to break it up into\n51:41\n50 like is it by a space I\n51:47\nmean yeah yeah and same with same with the facilitator um like the 200 per session\n51:56\num I guess the first ones will be kind of a drag because you're gearing up and then the later ones won't be such so\n52:02\nit's sort of you know making the commitment um does it make sense I think it does\n52:10\nyeah and the US of of a treasury instance is is comes in handy to people\n52:18\nthat want to particip take some tasks for example in my case there for example a person that can want to take for a\n52:25\nmonth the the marketing and promotional uh gimbal apps efforts right the this\n52:33\nperson can take the task and develop the task uh throughout the month and at the\n52:40\nend of the month in an open space for example you can evaluate okay your work is was refined or not or you can take\n52:48\nthis make decisions in general yeah so yeah I think that that is a\n52:55\nsafer way to do marketing just in general and it's more replicable you'd\n53:01\nbe able to essentially generate a workflow hey these are the places we need to be posting our stuff to this is\n53:07\nthe communities we need to be updating um and then once you have that workflow you can almost do it the same\n53:13\nway you have the 200 Ada per 90 minute session basically you would be able to\n53:19\nput a time slot assigned for that or whatever so like this this set of\n53:25\nworkflows this set of tasks takes this amount of time and that would allow you to better gauge Newman like how much\n53:33\nvalue that actually is now something else to consider and this is probably\n53:38\nmore fitting for gimbal Labs um I've also brought this to other like more governance minded cardano communities\n53:46\nintersect as well the way that Discord allows us to\n53:51\noperate allows for you know you guys to build with your partner ERS whoever\n53:57\nthose may be right other projects and other communities like for instance your announcements Channel I have those\n54:04\nfollowed with web hooks directly into some of our channels in our Discord I've also crossposted every one of the\n54:11\ncommunity events you guys have on your calendar directly into our Discord events right that as a tool allows you\n54:20\nyou guys to have way broader reach with very little added funding very little\n54:26\nadded time cost you know when you're making a post on the announcements Channel as long as you hit that little\n54:32\npublish button it's pushing directly out to everyone that has web hooks so maybe\n54:37\ninitially a small concerted effort to have that integration utilized by\n54:44\nPartners or specific communities um I mean gimbal Labs is open to everyone and\n54:50\nyou guys would make for a much better landing spot in my opinion for a lot of\n54:56\nother cardano community members looking to get more involved that's a really good way I think and I'm testr running\n55:01\nit right now with my own Juke boys community so we'll see but uh another\n55:07\nthing to note when it comes to marketing on Twitter spaces for instance it's a lot harder to stand up a\n55:14\nbrand new Twitter space than to like hit the media circuit that already exists\n55:20\nyou know and you'll have broader reach in my experience doing that last L part\n55:27\nnow I mean don't get me wrong I host Twitter spaces myself I would love to be a part of this if this is something you\n55:33\nguys are interested in uh we actually have been working on standing up our own media circuit throughout the week so\n55:39\nwe're looking at like 15 Twitter spaces per week right now and some of these\n55:45\neven turned to podcasts and other things and are cross posted elsewhere but tracking\n55:50\nmetrics on that scale is a lot harder I'll tell you that so you know being\n55:56\nable to measure the work you're putting in versus what's happening you know you\n56:02\nwould hate to be putting this much money and effort and time into this and then see you know 10 12 people showing up\n56:09\nevery session anyways like that's you know what are your kpis you definitely\n56:14\ngot to figure that out and then how are you going to track those I would suggest the use and this is something I'm trying\n56:20\nto get stood up in another Community right now use of things like bitly for\n56:25\nthese meetings links you'll be able to see just how many people are actually clicking through those and in the future\n56:32\nactually like where these people are coming from granted there are things like vpns and whatnot but my S my theory\n56:42\nis that most people at least on everyday Twitter stuff are not using they're not\n56:47\nusing their vpns you know so you'll get a pretty good idea as to what part of the world you guys are having good\n56:53\nOutreach in um you know but then there comes the whole you know managing of the\n56:59\ndata like who's getting access to this yeah\n57:04\nit's that's kind of my expertise though is marketing so basically I'm hearing my my replacement are you ready or\n57:13\nyou or are you or are you just a consulter because we don't need\n57:19\nconsulters we need the people that in this case replace me in the in the job so\n57:26\nI definitely be willing to offer whatever Services I can like I said I'm already working on standing up all the gimbal Labs events weekly in our Discord\n57:33\nthey're in our Google Calendar thanks to Steve for helping me out with that um but yeah we are trying to do everything\n57:40\nwe can what I will ask for you from Sebastian if you got a Media Kit I would\n57:45\nlove that because I did not find a consistent Media Kit or branding across\n57:50\nthe platforms so that that would help you maybe you can shagy\n57:58\nnotion notion account right or not not yet because we can because we can make a\n58:05\nan ocean dock when we can start sharing information and your needs and what you\n58:10\nneed to to to make the job and I can share with you what you are asking for\n58:17\nme supposing I'm supposing the moment that the maybe you can start to to work on the marketing and promotion side of\n58:24\nBops but just is my supposition or\n58:32\nno I'm game okay so let's make a okay so\n58:37\nlet's make a an ocean an ocean you can you can open an ocean yeah what it what\n58:43\nit makes me wonder is that like and I could go either way should we combine\n58:48\nthese into a single proposal where we're talking about marketing and keeping spaces open or should we Fork this\n58:54\ndocument into two smaller scope\n59:00\nproposals I think uh we already have two proposal one is marketing another is\n59:06\nresource or rethink or reallocating\n59:13\nresources we could just make a duplicate of this Doc and then keep the stuff\n59:18\nthat's related to each title for example\n59:26\nam I gonna do it we don't have to you know what we could do I I think it's safe to say that\n59:33\nwe're not going to get to consent on this proposal in the next 10 minutes that's fine 10 minutes yeah because we'll have the retroactive funding for\n59:40\nall the dates from January up to approval which will kick in when we get to approval as an action item let's\n59:49\nlet's take this proposal I'm happy to do it I'll take this I'll remove the the marketing stuff from\n59:57\nthe witch spaces proposal and then create a unique copy that has just the marketing notes and hand that off to\n1:00:03\nSebastian and Shaggy I think that's brilliant especially because there's multiple layers here\n1:00:10\nright one part you want to bring people into the sessions that's cool right and\n1:00:15\nlike Market gimbal labs in general but you also have fully finished and\n1:00:21\nfunctional products right so like the andamio stuff things that you guys have stood up in the past\n1:00:27\nthat would be a separate layer of marketing so I would agree that you know having that broke off you definitely\n1:00:33\nwant to drive people to the work you guys have already done and been funded for that's better for their entire\n1:00:38\ncardano ecosystem in my opinion you know more people running through the indom courses that's good because it's more\n1:00:44\nbang for our buck so to speak um and however we can do that what I will say\n1:00:50\nalthough I may be good with marketing not necessarily great with people so uh\n1:00:56\nI know that sounds a little contrarian Newman started this meeting by talking about Mad Men so yeah that's yeah I know\n1:01:03\nright having um having somebody who's well known and well-liked in the\n1:01:08\ncommunity kind of focusing in on the partnership arm of stuff that's probably a good idea and I'm not sure who would\n1:01:15\nwant to do that or take point on that but basically somebody to go make contact with other communities and then\n1:01:22\nkind of push the marketing request over to them hey look we would would just like you to go through this quick\n1:01:27\nprocess we can make a one page for it here's how you'd hook web hooks up to certain Discord channels um and then\n1:01:34\nhere's how you put the events in there here are the links we want you to push thank God you guys have the gimal ABS\n1:01:40\ncalendar link because that way they don't have to individually schedule each meeting right they'll just put the gimal\n1:01:46\nABS calendar right there and then wherever it's pulling from it's a lot easier he just to conclude from my side\n1:01:53\nthis this issue of the marketing again galap marketing we studied at gimbals we studied many things in for in a in an\n1:02:01\nunal informal way right one of those is marketing and promotion but today we\n1:02:06\nhave structures and we have methodologies that we we can start to use to to to formalize some\n1:02:14\nprocedures ER marketing and promotion is one of those right so I I think I can\n1:02:22\nlet you build the proposal that you want to to to Implement in the area later\n1:02:29\nwhen you have the proposal I I can start to to to provide you feedback about okay\n1:02:34\nhow I can help you to to give you the tools that you need to to start your\n1:02:42\nwork and yes DM me and DM me say me okay\n1:02:47\nI I have I already have the proposal so please check check it and and I I can I\n1:02:54\ncan help you to to I can provide you all the help you need to to start I'm going to DM you on the Discord for sure you\n1:03:02\nyou have you have to make the proposal in the in the based on what we do today\n1:03:08\nwe didn't do this a few years ago but today is an exciting time for GS so okay\n1:03:15\nand thanks for for your work I don't know if you you want to plans you you had plans to for this but welcome\n1:03:21\nwelcome on Art yeah I I very happy that\n1:03:26\nwe get we drill down to that because I think that's an example of this process you know like finding the thing um uh\n1:03:34\nand it yeah it definitely fits our our driver of the you know open replicable\n1:03:40\nsafe spaces um so it really really makes sense to me and I'm I'm fully supportive\n1:03:46\nof a different uh uh proposal centered\n1:03:51\naround marketing and establishing that initial setup and then the funding I do\n1:03:56\nthink that that 58 per uh like would be a good enough incentive to somebody to\n1:04:02\nwork the workflow but to establish the workflow that's probably needs a\n1:04:08\nseparate a separate system yeah that's awesome separate proposal\n1:04:14\nguys like be be ambitious and generous to yourselves in the budget\n1:04:20\nrequested right give us again like do that service of giving us something to argue with by bringing an ambitious\n1:04:28\nproposal but Tak in account that we are a public service organization right like\n1:04:34\na like a the radi station po R station in your country right uh so our budget\n1:04:42\nis modest in some way but we have budget to pay people for the work\n1:04:47\nso let's bring awesome\n1:04:54\nthings I I mean for me the thing is where're we\n1:04:59\nwe we might be getting close to a point where we need to spend the funds we have\n1:05:05\nfaster if we don't spend the funds we have what right do we have to ask for more so having a record that these funds\n1:05:13\nwere actually used and they went to these people for these things and here's what we got done that's what I want to see if I'm if\n1:05:22\nI'm voting on some future proposal to fund this organization or that ecosystem\n1:05:28\nhave they been stewards of what they've got um so I want to make sure we finish spending the fund 12 money right and\n1:05:35\nthen as the fund 13 money comes in let's let's it's there to be used not there to\n1:05:41\njust sit waiting for us yeah that's right but it you need to be bold in some\n1:05:47\nthings and have bold ideas man you have to bring in them here and and we think\n1:05:53\nhow to to make that y\n1:05:59\nyep love it awesome Newman thanks for taking over on that that's that felt\n1:06:05\nlike a really good handoff and I appreciate having you just capturing those notes um perfect so yeah like I\n1:06:11\nsaid I'll I'll make a duplicate of this proposal um keep keep the witch spaces\n1:06:19\nstuff as I understand it keep the marketing stuff in a separate proposal\n1:06:24\num ping and Shaggy and you guys take it from there that's amazing um and then we'll this is perfect I didn't expect to\n1:06:31\nget fully to consent today because like you guys saw there were some missing details in The Proposal I brought today\n1:06:39\nand by having this conversation I think I have enough to fill in the blanks and bring to next\n1:06:45\nThursday's meeting a proposal that's that's ready for consent and so we'll do the I won't read it line by line again\n1:06:53\num but I will ask for clarifying questions and then um and then we'll take\n1:06:58\nobjections to it and we'll refine it until it's good enough to go yes Seb uh\n1:07:04\nwe don't have time but I I would like to to make some I I wanted to to make to\n1:07:10\noffer you an update from the of the Marlo P proposal currently but not today\n1:07:16\nyou can go to the proposal and read it it's updated with the recent uh uh\n1:07:23\ninformation and recent situations about the The Proposal so maybe in the next\n1:07:29\nwell we're we're about to transition to Dev time you want to give us a one minute version and a link to read uh\n1:07:36\nyeah basically the proposal will be managed through a a treasury right like\n1:07:42\nwe our usual businesses put the funds in a treasury and and from there start to distribute\n1:07:48\nthe several task that the proposal need to to be implemented H the Marlo\n1:07:54\nproposal won't be different um we had some issue with the the previous\n1:08:00\nMilestones but fortunately H Catal uh support us to to modify the the\n1:08:06\nmilestones and and bring a more feasible implementation and in summary uh today\n1:08:14\nif you go to the dog you will see the the how the proposal will be implemented\n1:08:20\nand the proposal will be open to the participation of the the contributor to\n1:08:26\nneed it to build the course and build the content and will be an open an open\n1:08:32\nproject to open participation so just go to a proposal\n1:08:38\nand if you have some my idea is to be as open and transparent as possible in the\n1:08:45\nimplementation and and in the distribution of funds so just go to a proposal is my in my invitation and and\n1:08:54\ncheck it uh review it and if you have some questions about implementation\n1:08:59\nabout all the activities please let the posted in the in the document and I'll\n1:09:06\nbe I'll be attend to to make you give you answers yeah thanks aot thanks\n1:09:13\npartner uh yeah there's a lot of unknowns about the future of Marlo but uh we find ourselves with an opportunity\n1:09:19\nto help um so looking forward to getting that one off the ground um and Sebastian\n1:09:24\nhas worked over time to reconfigure the proposal um in a\n1:09:29\nworld where Marlo wasn't quite getting the support it needed uh we'll see we'll see it's it's hard to know if this is a\n1:09:35\ngood idea to be working on Marlo at all right now but that's kind of that gives us some freedom to experiment with it\n1:09:42\nbut it's it's a good idea because we are open to contributors and content creators and independent of what will\n1:09:49\nhappen with the with the with the language H there there are people that know and have some a really good\n1:09:57\nknowledge in in in domain of of Marlo they can so in that point they can teach\n1:10:04\nwhat they they they know so that's that's valid so okay that's it thanks\n1:10:12\namazing um okay so we are now at the end of the Open Spaces meeting and what we're doing uh for the next few months\n1:10:20\nat least is on Thursdays we're trying this idea of going straight into a\n1:10:25\ntechnical meeting um to make that transition I just want to share screen\n1:10:30\nfor a minute and show you one thing about Notions sometimes we do this thing\n1:10:37\nright we're using this technical tool people are on boarding to it and you're learning about what it can do I'm on the\n1:10:43\nhomepage of the gimal ABS notion right here it's called gimal ABS HQ and the most important thing to know\n1:10:52\nabout notion is that every page p is also a database all right so if those words\n1:10:59\nmean anything to you page and database just know that in notion they're the same thing what this means is what looks\n1:11:06\nlike a page can also be a repository for new data and what I wanted to do here is\n1:11:13\njust start building a new system in real time we can evolve it as we go but we\n1:11:20\ndon't yet have a space here for keeping track of these weekly Dev standards\n1:11:26\nwe do have a great space to keep track of Open Spaces that's our project list and this has evolved in the year or so\n1:11:33\nthat we've been using it to the point where facilitation of Open Spaces has gotten a lot easier I basically say the\n1:11:39\nsame thing at the start of every meeting um and that's giving and I'm practicing the way I even want to say that so I\n1:11:47\njust want to show you one more thing here's the start here page for gimal abs\n1:11:52\nwe recognize that we might want to create some something around our weekly\n1:11:58\nDev standup and you know what it might need its own home page it might need its\n1:12:04\nown directory that's all fine we can build that someday but for now I don't\n1:12:10\nwant to think about building a system this is what emergence is right you don't try to define the whole system in\n1:12:15\na top down centralized way you start from the bottom what's the need today oh\n1:12:21\nwell the need today is for us to get together and talk about whatever is on our shared agenda so what I'm going to\n1:12:28\ndo here is I'm going to type a slash and you can see this slash command menu pops\n1:12:34\nup and I could either choose page or just start writing the word page when I do that and I press enter\n1:12:42\nlook what happens oh it's a new page great so I'm going to do is I'm going to call this Dev stand up put today's date\n1:12:51\non it the 3 of March March no March 6 okay and\n1:12:59\nthen let's just create an agenda and what I was hoping we could do is if you have something that you'd like to talk\n1:13:05\nabout during the dev standup today let's just put it in writing right here and\n1:13:11\nthat'll be our agenda for the next 90 minutes um after we create this agenda\n1:13:16\nI'll press stop recording on the Open Spaces and if anybody if we need to take\n1:13:22\nlike a minute break we can do that before we jump back in um but just to close out here um open floor what's on\n1:13:29\neverybody's agenda to discuss today at our Dev standup James would you please share\n1:13:35\nthis link the link to this here's the editable\n1:13:42\none if I could just now I can't find chat here it is and is it linked\n1:13:48\nsomewhere when you made it does it like create it let me go back to the page I was on so remember where I typed slash\n1:13:55\npage now there's a link from the h\n1:14:02\nstart got it got it y so that's how easy you write slash page now you got a new\n1:14:07\npage and you can move that page to anywhere um but this I think notion is\n1:14:13\nbuilt well for emergence or to say that with less fancy language notion is a\n1:14:21\nreally good tool to use when you're not fully sure what you're doing I find it's\n1:14:27\nreally good for that um so aeria

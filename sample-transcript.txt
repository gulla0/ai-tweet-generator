DAO Governance Meeting - March 15, 2025

MODERATOR: Welcome everyone to our monthly DAO governance meeting. We have a packed agenda today, so let's get started. First, I'd like to welcome everyone and thank you for joining us.

ALEX (Governance Lead): Thanks, Moderator. We've had a very productive month in the governance working group. Before diving into proposals, I want to share that our active voter participation has increased by 32% since implementing the delegation system last quarter. We now have over 5,000 active voters!

TAYLOR (Tech Lead): That's incredible growth! The technical committee has been working hard on the governance portal improvements. The new voting interface will be deployed next week, which should make participating even more accessible.

MORGAN (Treasury Lead): From the treasury side, we've completed our quarterly audit. I'm pleased to report that our treasury has grown by 15% despite market conditions, currently sitting at 2.3 million in our reserve. All financial reports are available on our transparency dashboard.

ALEX: Great news about the treasury. Now for our main proposals - we have three major governance proposals on the table. The first is GIP-27 regarding adjustments to the grant program criteria. The community feedback period ends tomorrow, so please review and share your thoughts.

JORDAN (Community Lead): The community engagement team has been organizing local meetups in 12 cities this past month. Attendance has been fantastic, and we're seeing a lot of new contributors joining working groups afterward. The Amsterdam event was particularly successful with over 200 attendees.

TAYLOR: I'd like to add that the security audit for the DAO's smart contracts has been completed. We received a positive report with only two minor issues, which have already been addressed. The full report is available on our GitHub.

CHRIS (Research Lead): The research collective has published our quarterly report on governance trends across the ecosystem. Our analysis shows that our DAO has one of the highest engagement rates compared to other similarly sized organizations. The report includes actionable recommendations for increasing inclusivity.

ALEX: Thanks for that update, Chris. For our second proposal, GIP-28, we're considering implementing a reputation-based voting mechanism alongside token voting. We've been researching this for months, and the simulation results look promising for balancing incentives.

MORGAN: I'd also like to discuss our upcoming treasury diversification strategy. We're proposing to allocate 10% of our reserves into yield-generating positions, which could provide sustainable funding for core operations without depleting our main treasury.

TAYLOR: On the technical roadmap, we've prioritized the development of the contributor credentialing system for Q2. This will help recognize valuable contributors even if they're not heavily token-weighted voters. The spec is complete, and we're now starting development.

ALEX: Our final proposal today, GIP-29, addresses the delegation improvements that many community members have requested. The new system would allow for fine-grained delegation by proposal category rather than blanket delegation.

JORDAN: Before we wrap up, I'd like to mention our education initiative. We've created a "DAO Governance 101" course that has already onboarded 300 new members. We've translated it into five languages, with more on the way thanks to our translation working group.

MODERATOR: Thank you all for these updates. Let's open the floor for questions from community members.

COMMUNITY MEMBER 1: I'm curious about the reputation-based voting - how will you prevent gaming of the system?

ALEX: Great question. We've designed several mechanisms to prevent gaming, including time-locking of reputation points and requiring attestations from existing members. The full anti-sybil measures are detailed in the proposal document.

COMMUNITY MEMBER 2: Regarding treasury diversification, what are the risk management strategies you're implementing?

MORGAN: We're taking a very conservative approach. All positions will be in blue-chip protocols with established security records, capped exposure per protocol, and with governance-approved smart contract coverage. We've also engaged risk management specialists to create our framework.

MODERATOR: We have time for one more question.

COMMUNITY MEMBER 3: Will the new governance portal include better notification systems? I often miss voting deadlines.

TAYLOR: Absolutely! The new portal includes customizable notifications via email, Discord, and on-chain wallet notifications. You'll be able to select which proposal types you want to be notified about and how far in advance.

MODERATOR: Thank you everyone for your participation today. The recording and transcript of this meeting will be available on our governance forum within 24 hours. Our next governance call will be on April 15th.
